# Preflight

**Preflight is a local-first predictive runtime guard for AI coding agents.**
Before and during each turn with a provider like Codex or Claude Code, it
estimates scope, token/quota consumption, completion likelihood, and
blast-radius risk, then applies policy to run, warn, checkpoint, split,
gracefully pause, or block that turn.

It answers a different question than checkpoint/resume/memory tools do:
not "how do we continue?" but **"should we even start this turn?"**

## Source of truth

| Document | Role |
|---|---|
| [`CONSTITUTION.md`](CONSTITUTION.md) | **Supreme process authority.** Single-source-of-truth hierarchy, document precedence, ADR rules, path ownership, provider-addition criteria, Progress Tree invariants, and the rules every agent must follow. Read this first. |
| [`Preflight_ADD.md`](Preflight_ADD.md) | **The single authoritative architecture and implementation specification.** When code, issues, PRs, or comments conflict with it, this document (and accepted ADRs under `docs/adr/`) wins for architecture. |
| [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) | Contributor/agent quick-reference — required reading before any implementation work. |
| [`Preflight_Parallel_Execution_Plan.md`](Preflight_Parallel_Execution_Plan.md) | Subordinate execution plan for the first vertical-slice build: seven-role topology, ownership boundaries, merge order. |
| [`agents/`](agents/) | One canonical role definition per bounded context, linked from the plan above. |
| [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) | Accepted Architecture Decision Records — full-detail companions to the short entries in `Preflight_ADD.md` §33. |
| [`Preflight_Predictor_Design_Supplement.md`](Preflight_Predictor_Design_Supplement.md) | Predictor pipeline design detail (Scope/Token/Quota Forecast, Risk Estimation) — companion to `Preflight_ADD.md` §14-17, formalized by ADR-041. |
| [`docs/implementation/vertical-slice/`](docs/implementation/vertical-slice/) | Live vertical-slice execution status: `EXECUTION_DAG.md` (task-level DAG, amended by ADR-041), `CONTRACT_FREEZE.md`, per-role progress artifacts, lessons learned, and post-wave analyses. |
| [`docs/repository_inventory.md`](docs/repository_inventory.md) | Audit of every markdown file in the repo and its authority/status. |
| [`docs/archive/`](docs/archive/) | Superseded documents, kept for historical reference, not for implementation. |

`CONSTITUTION.md` governs process; `Preflight_ADD.md` governs architecture —
see `CONSTITUTION.md` §8 for how the two relate. Do not treat any other
document, prior draft, or conversation as authoritative over either.

## Two core continuity guarantees

- **State Checkpointing** — no unit of work may be marked complete without
  durable, validator-checked evidence (file, DB record, checksum, Git
  snapshot).
- **Graceful Pause** — when a quota limit is calibrated-likely to hit soon,
  Preflight checkpoints state, interrupts at a safe point, and persists a
  durable wake job in SQLite; auto-resume is opt-in and re-verified before
  it runs.

See `Preflight_ADD.md` §1 for the full executive decision record.

## What an AI-assisted session sees — and what it can do

When Preflight is wired into an AI coding session (today: Claude Code
native hook mode, wired per [`integrations/claude/`](integrations/claude/)),
it evaluates every prompt before it runs and keeps observing the session
while it runs. Every signal below is machine-readable (`--json`, FR-160),
so it serves two readers at once: the **human developer** deciding whether
to let a turn proceed, and the **coding agent itself**, which receives the
gate's decision through the hook response.

### Signals

| Signal | Produced by | Surfaces via |
|---|---|---|
| Task class + scope estimate (expected file/LOC bands) | prompt feature extraction (privacy-bounded — raw prompt is never retained) → rule scope estimator | `preflight evaluate`, UserPromptSubmit hook |
| Token forecast (P50/P80/P90 quantile bands) | Token Forecaster (`internal/predictor/token`, ADR-041) | same |
| Quota fit — will this turn fit the remaining window | Quota Forecaster (`internal/predictor/quota`) | same |
| Runway score — will the session survive the next ~10 minutes | status-line telemetry → runway scorer, consumed by pause Observe (debounce/hysteresis) | `preflight hook claude statusline`, pause observe loop |
| Risk score — **an uncalibrated score, never called a probability** (Constitution principle #2; cold-start policy emits `probability: null`) | risk combiner (`internal/predictor/risk`) | `preflight evaluate` |
| Policy decision — one of the eight frozen actions: `RUN`, `WARN`, `REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION`, `CHECKPOINT_AND_RUN`, `SPLIT`, `PAUSE`, `PAUSE_AND_AUTO_RESUME`, `BLOCK` | policy engine (`internal/policy`) | UserPromptSubmit hook response, `preflight decision` |
| Progress Tree node states — completion is evidence-backed, never the agent's own claim of "done" | `internal/progress` CompleteNode atomic protocol | `preflight status` |
| Checkpoint / pause / wake-job state | state + repository checkpoint stores, pause records | `preflight status` |
| Environment health (DB, migrations, paths, git) | diagnostics | `preflight doctor` |

### Actions

The per-prompt gate acts automatically: the policy action above returns as
the UserPromptSubmit hook response (allow, warn with context, require a
checkpoint first, or block), and the hook stays provider-compatible even
on internal failure. Beyond that, the human or the agent can invoke:

```text
preflight evaluate               estimate a prompt before running it (--prompt-file|-, --json;
                                 prints the forecast card: scope/tokens/cost/risk/action)
preflight decision allow|deny    consume a one-time authorization (replays are rejected)
preflight checkpoint create      State Checkpoint + Repository Checkpoint (never mutates the active branch)
preflight progress complete      evidence-carrying node completion (--node, --idempotency-key,
                                 --artifact kind=path; validator-gated per Constitution §6)
preflight pause request|cancel   safe-point pause with a durable wake job
preflight resume                 re-verified resume (repo/quota/session/authorization re-checked first)
preflight scheduler run-once     execute due wake jobs (daemon-run automation: #7)
preflight status | doctor        session/checkpoint/pause state; environment health
preflight hook claude <event>    the four hook entrypoints Claude Code calls
                                 (user-prompt-submit, stop, stop-failure, statusline;
                                 statusline --emit-line also renders the status bar text)
```

### Known limits today

- Native hook mode doesn't yet create repository/worktree/session rows,
  so the evaluation pipeline (and the #14 forecast card) silently
  cold-starts in real sessions until
  [#17](https://github.com/huaiche94/preflight/issues/17) lands — found
  by dogfooding on day one.
- Unattended auto-resume needs the M6 daemon
  ([#7](https://github.com/huaiche94/preflight/issues/7)); until then
  wake jobs fire via `scheduler run-once`.
- All forecasts are uncalibrated scores/ranges; calibrated probabilities
  require accumulated real telemetry
  ([#11](https://github.com/huaiche94/preflight/issues/11)) — now
  flowing via dogfooding.

## How to use this repo

### Build and run

```bash
go build -o preflight ./cmd/preflight
./preflight version
./preflight doctor      # verifies DB connectivity + migration state
./preflight --help      # full command tree
```

Requires Go 1.26.x (see [Tech stack](#tech-stack)); no CGO, no external
services. The first run creates and migrates a SQLite database under the
OS user data directory (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/preflight/`,
Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/preflight/`), so `doctor` is a meaningful check
immediately after building.

### Wire it into Claude Code

Follow [`integrations/claude/`](integrations/claude/) — it ships the
`hooks.json`/`plugin.json` examples that route Claude Code's
UserPromptSubmit / Stop / StopFailure / statusline events through
`preflight hook claude <event>`. The [Signals](#signals) and
[Actions](#actions) sections above describe what you get once wired.

### What you'll see

Preflight is a headless CLI — its "interface" is schema-versioned JSON on
stdout plus the hook responses Claude Code receives. Everything below is
**real captured output** (a live run of the compiled binary, or golden
files recorded by the test suite), not mockups.

**The per-prompt gate** — what Claude Code receives back from the
UserPromptSubmit hook. An allowed prompt gets a pass-through `{}`; a
blocked one gets a decision the agent itself can read and act on:

```json
{
  "decision": "block",
  "reason": "Preflight evaluation eval_123 requires a checkpoint or explicit override before this task starts.",
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "UserPromptSubmit",
    "additionalContext": "Use the durable Preflight Progress Tree and checkpoint policy."
  }
}
```

**Environment health** — `preflight doctor` (live run, freshly-migrated DB):

```json
{"schema_version":"preflight.doctor.v1","healthy":true,"checks":[
  {"name":"database","status":"ok","detail":"reachable, schema version 52"},
  {"name":"config","status":"skipped","detail":"no config loader configured"}]}
```

**Checkpoint + one-time authorization** — `preflight checkpoint create`
and `preflight decision allow` (golden outputs from
[`internal/cli/testdata/golden/`](internal/cli/testdata/golden/)):

```json
{
  "schema_version": "preflight.checkpoint-create.v1",
  "state_checkpoint_id": "sc-golden-1",
  "repository_checkpoint_id": "rc-golden-1",
  "repository_checkpoint_git_head": "cafef00dcafef00dcafef00dcafef00dcafef00d"
}
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": "preflight.decision-allow.v1",
  "issued": true,
  "consumed": false,
  "authorization_id": "auth-golden-1",
  "action": "REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION"
}
```

**The error contract** — every command fails with the same typed,
machine-readable shape (live run; raw prompt text never appears in any
output, FR-160/privacy contract):

```json
{"schema_version":"preflight.error.v1","code":"validation",
 "message":"pause request: --reason must be one of \"calibrated_hit_probability\", \"emergency_uncalibrated\"",
 "retryable":false,"details":{"reason":"quota_hit"}}
```

**Planned, not built yet** — the human-facing at-a-glance surface is the
M12 VS Code companion ([#10](https://github.com/huaiche94/preflight/issues/10),
blocked on the M6 daemon [#7](https://github.com/huaiche94/preflight/issues/7)):
a sidebar with Quota & Runway / Risk Factors / Progress Tree /
Checkpoints / Paused Tasks views, and a status bar per ADD §25.3:

```text
$(shield) Preflight: 5h 87% · 10m 83% · node 3/7
$(debug-pause) Preflight paused · resumes after 22:14
```

A richer per-prompt forecast card (tokens/cost/scope on every prompt) is
tracked in [#14](https://github.com/huaiche94/preflight/issues/14). There
is deliberately no standalone usage dashboard — ADD §4.1 scopes that out
as an adjacent product category.

### Validate a change

Every wave of this repo's own build was gated on exactly these, and they
are the expected local pre-commit bar:

```bash
gofmt -l . && go build ./... && go vet ./...
go test ./... -race
golangci-lint run ./...
```

CI ([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs the same
across Ubuntu/macOS/Windows.

### Find your way around the docs

- **Contributing or running an agent against this repo:** read
  [`CONSTITUTION.md`](CONSTITUTION.md) (process rules), then
  [`Preflight_ADD.md`](Preflight_ADD.md) (architecture), then
  [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) (quick reference) — in that order, per the
  [Source of truth](#source-of-truth) table.
- **Understanding how the slice was built:** the
  [Wave roadmap](#wave-roadmap) below links every task group to its
  role's progress artifact and every wave to its integration commit;
  [`docs/implementation/vertical-slice/EXECUTION_DAG.md`](docs/implementation/vertical-slice/EXECUTION_DAG.md)
  is the task-level plan it executed.
- **Reusing the process on another project:**
  [`docs/methodology/Preflight_Development_Methodology.md`](docs/methodology/Preflight_Development_Methodology.md)
  distills the multi-agent, evidence-based process this repo was built
  with into a standalone, citable methodology.
- **What's next:** the [issue tracker](https://github.com/huaiche94/preflight/issues)
  holds the groomed post-slice backlog (open P1, security follow-ups,
  ADR-needed items, and roadmap milestones M6-M13).

## Wave roadmap

The vertical slice is 84 tasks + 1 final integration across 7 roles
(see `docs/implementation/vertical-slice/EXECUTION_DAG.md`, as amended by ADR-041).
Stages and task dependencies are canonical in that DAG; **waves** are the
integration rounds the work actually ships in. Waves 1–2 below are as
executed. Wave 3 onward is a provisional, dependency-derived grouping —
each wave is re-planned by the lead before it starts (see
`docs/implementation/vertical-slice/wave2-analysis/` for the inputs to Wave 3
planning) and must respect the DAG's stage and dependency order.

Each task-ID group below links to the owning role's progress artifact
(per-node status/artifact/validation logs); each commit hash links to the
integration commit on GitHub.

See [`contract-integrator.md`](docs/implementation/vertical-slice/contract-integrator.md)'s Stage 5 section |

Wave 5 onward is intentionally not fixed in detail — each wave is
re-derived from the DAG's actual dependency edges once the prior wave
integrates (see `docs/implementation/vertical-slice/wave2-analysis/Wave3_Recommendation.md`
for the method), not planned far in advance against a DAG that keeps
changing shape as work lands.

`→` marks in-wave sequencing on a role's branch; `·` separates parallel
role branches within the same wave.
