# Auspex

> 🌐 English | [繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md)

**Auspex is a local-first predictive runtime guard for AI coding agents.**
Before each turn with a provider like Claude Code, it estimates what the
turn will cost — scope, tokens, quota fit, blast-radius risk — and applies
policy: run it, warn, require a checkpoint first, split it, pause
gracefully, or block it.

Checkpoint/resume/memory tools answer *"how do we continue?"*. Auspex
answers the question that comes first: **"should we even start this
turn?"** (The Latin *auspex* is the diviner who reads the omens before an
undertaking begins and rules whether it may proceed.)

## What it does, in one session

Once wired into Claude Code (see [Quick start](#quick-start)), every
prompt you submit is evaluated before it runs. This is real output from
one of this repository's own development sessions — Auspex dogfoods
itself daily:

```text
Auspex forecast (uncalibrated estimate — scores are not probabilities):
  scope: ~1–4 files changed, ~30–180 lines, ~2–6 files read (P50–P90)
  tokens: P50 3782 / P80 5732 / P90 7564
  cost: ~$0.04–$0.38 USD (estimate)
  context: P90 ~3% of window (projected)
  risk: 0.50/1.00 overall — QUOTA_UNKNOWN, PREDICTION_COLD_START
  policy: WARN
```

The evaluation feeds a policy engine with **eight frozen actions**
(`RUN`, `WARN`, `REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION`, `CHECKPOINT_AND_RUN`, `SPLIT`,
`PAUSE`, `PAUSE_AND_AUTO_RESUME`, `BLOCK`). The decision returns to the
agent through the hook response — an allowed prompt passes through, a
blocked one carries a machine-readable reason the agent itself can act
on. Alongside the per-prompt gate, Auspex maintains:

- **A Progress Tree** — the canonical, durable task state. A node may
  not be marked complete without validator-checked evidence (a file, DB
  record, checksum, or Git snapshot); "the agent said it's done" never
  counts.
- **State + repository checkpoints** — every node completion creates a
  state checkpoint atomically; repository checkpoints capture the
  worktree (with secret redaction) without ever committing your branch.
- **Graceful Pause** — when the quota window is about to run out,
  Auspex checkpoints, interrupts at a safe point, and persists a durable
  wake job in SQLite. The daemon (`auspex daemon`) executes due wake
  jobs unattended; resume re-verifies repository, quota, session, and
  authorization before running.

Everything is local: one static Go binary, one SQLite database under
your OS user-data directory, no cloud services. Raw prompt text and tool
output are never persisted by default — only extracted features.

## Quick start

Requires Go 1.26.5 (pinned in `go.mod`); no CGO, no external services.

```bash
go build -o auspex ./cmd/auspex
./auspex version
./auspex doctor      # creates + migrates the SQLite DB, then verifies it
```

`doctor` is meaningful immediately after building: the first run creates
the database under the OS user-data directory (macOS:
`~/Library/Application Support/auspex/`, Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/auspex/`)
and reports each check (`database`, `config`, …) with a per-check status.

To wire it into Claude Code, follow
[`integrations/claude/`](integrations/claude/README.md): it ships the
`hooks.json`/`plugin.json` examples that route Claude Code's
UserPromptSubmit / Stop / StopFailure / statusline events through
`auspex hook claude <event>`, plus `auspex init` to register the current
repository. The hooks **fail open** — an Auspex crash never blocks your
session; run `auspex evaluate` directly to surface real errors.

### The command tree

```text
auspex evaluate               estimate a prompt before running it (--json)
auspex decision allow|deny    consume a one-time authorization (replays rejected)
auspex checkpoint create      state + repository checkpoint (never commits your branch)
auspex progress ...           inspect the Progress Tree; evidence-gated completion
auspex pause request|cancel   safe-point pause with a durable wake job
auspex resume                 re-verified resume
auspex scheduler run-once     execute due wake jobs without the daemon
auspex daemon ...             background daemon + authenticated loopback HTTP API
auspex run ...                run a provider one-shot prompt under the managed gate
auspex init                   register the current repository/session
auspex status | doctor        session/checkpoint/pause state; environment health
auspex gc                     tiered telemetry retention (90-day default, ADR-046)
auspex export                 de-identified datasets for offline analysis
auspex hook claude <event>    the four hook entrypoints Claude Code calls
```

Every command speaks schema-versioned JSON on stdout (`--json`, FR-160)
and fails with one typed error shape, so both humans and agents can
consume it:

```json
{"schema_version":"auspex.error.v1","code":"validation",
 "message":"pause request: --reason must be one of \"calibrated_hit_probability\", \"emergency_uncalibrated\"",
 "retryable":false,"details":{"reason":"quota_hit"}}
```

A VS Code companion extension ([`vscode/`](vscode/README.md)) shows
daemon status, the wake-job queue, and an inline cancel button for
scheduled resumes; it is used from source or a locally packaged VSIX
until the marketplace publisher is registered
([#18](https://github.com/huaiche94/auspex/issues/18)).

## Project status

The full vertical slice — 85/85 DAG nodes across seven roles, Bootstrap
through the Stage-5 integration gate — is integrated on `main`, followed
by the post-slice backlog: the daemon with its authenticated loopback
API ([#7](https://github.com/huaiche94/auspex/issues/7)), native-hook
session bootstrap ([#17](https://github.com/huaiche94/auspex/issues/17)),
the per-prompt forecast surface
([#14](https://github.com/huaiche94/auspex/issues/14)), tiered telemetry
retention (ADR-046), real repository-checkpoint restore
([#6](https://github.com/huaiche94/auspex/issues/6)), and the VS Code
companion MVP. This repository's own Claude Code sessions feed telemetry
into a local Auspex daily.

**The honest caveat:** every forecast is still produced by cold-start
rules, not calibrated models. Scores are not probabilities and are
labeled that way on every surface (Constitution §7 rule 7). The token
forecast in particular barely responds to the prompt yet
([#42](https://github.com/huaiche94/auspex/issues/42)); calibration from
accumulated real telemetry is the M13 milestone
([#11](https://github.com/huaiche94/auspex/issues/11)).

Open roadmap milestones: Codex provider adapter (M7/M8,
[#9](https://github.com/huaiche94/auspex/issues/9)), managed one-shot and
shell modes (M11, [#8](https://github.com/huaiche94/auspex/issues/8)),
full VS Code companion (M12,
[#10](https://github.com/huaiche94/auspex/issues/10)), calibration
pipeline (M13, #11). The
[issue tracker](https://github.com/huaiche94/auspex/issues) is the live
backlog. Work is milestone-gated: nothing is implemented ahead of its
milestone (`docs/design/Auspex_ADD.md` §31).

## Validate a change

The local pre-commit bar, and exactly what CI
([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)) runs on
ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, and windows-latest — all three
hard-blocking:

```bash
gofmt -l . && go build ./... && go vet ./...
go test ./... -race
golangci-lint run ./...
```

Every folder has its own `README.md` introducing what lives there, and
every documentation file has a Traditional Chinese sibling
(`<name>.zh-TW.md`, ADR-049). The authoring language is normative:
English for everything except `docs/design/Auspex_ADD.md` and
`docs/DECISION_LOG.md`, which are authored in Traditional Chinese.

## Where to read next

| You want to… | Read |

| Understand the architecture | [`docs/design/Auspex_ADD.md`](docs/design/Auspex_ADD.md) — the single authoritative architecture/requirements spec, authored in Traditional Chinese (normative as written); amended only by ADRs under [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) |
| Contribute (human or agent) | [`CONSTITUTION.md`](CONSTITUTION.md) (process authority) → [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) → [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) |
| See how the predictor works | [`docs/design/Auspex_Predictor_Design_Supplement.md`](docs/design/Auspex_Predictor_Design_Supplement.md) + [`internal/predictor/`](internal/predictor/README.md) |
| Trace how this repo was built | [`docs/implementation/vertical-slice/`](docs/implementation/vertical-slice/README.md) — the execution DAG, wave-by-wave integration history, per-role progress logs |
| Reuse the multi-agent process | [`docs/methodology/`](docs/methodology/README.md) |
| Browse all documentation | [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) |

`CONSTITUTION.md` governs process; `docs/design/Auspex_ADD.md` governs
architecture. When any other document disagrees with them, those two
win (Constitution §1–§2).
