|---|---|
| Phase | 3.1 — Post Wave 2 Analysis |
| Scope | Every completed node, Bootstrap through Wave 2 (19 executed units) |
| Status | Analysis only. No implementation, DAG, or contract changes. |
| Generated | 2026-07-12 |

## 0. Method and honesty constraints

Every value below is labeled with one of: **Observed** (measured directly by
the lead via `git diff --stat`, `git show`, or a harness-reported usage
block), **Estimated** (a self-report from the executing agent, not
independently measured — e.g. "~20 min wall-clock" from a model with no
clock access), **Derived** (computed from other values), or **Unknown**
(no data exists; not fabricated).

Two structural facts constrain this entire report and recur in every row:

1. **The frozen DAG (`docs/implementation/vertical-slice/EXECUTION_DAG.md`) has no
   duration field and no token field anywhere, for any node.** Every
   `estimated_duration` and `estimated_token_usage` cell below is
   therefore `Unknown` — not a small number, not zero. This is the
   single largest finding of this report and is treated at length in
   Phase 3.6.
2. **No "files read" metric was captured by any teammate for any node.**
   Only "files changed" (files written/modified) was tracked. Tool-call
   counts (`tool_uses` in harness usage blocks) exist but conflate reads,
   writes, edits, and shell commands — reporting them as a "files read"
   proxy would be a fabrication by relabeling. `actual_files_read` is
   `Unknown` for every node.

Actual token usage is only `Observed` at **teammate-per-wave granularity**
(one number per background-agent invocation, covering every node that
invocation completed), never at per-node granularity, because the
sub-agents did not self-report a token breakdown per node and the harness
does not expose one. Where a node shares a teammate-wave token total with
sibling nodes, this is stated explicitly rather than divided evenly and
presented as if it were per-node data.

### foundation-01

### foundation-04 (reduced scope: `internal/lock` only)

| Metric | Estimated | Actual | Provenance | Abs. error | % error |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Files changed | 6 (original full-scope DAG estimate — **not comparable**, see note) | 4 (`git show --stat 1ce3c50`) | Observed (stale) / Observed | N/A — not apples-to-apples | N/A |
| Files read | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown / Unknown | — | — |
| LOC | 150 (original full-scope estimate — **not comparable**) | 370 insertions | Observed (stale) / Observed | N/A | N/A |
| Duration | Unknown | ~20 min (self-reported) | Unknown / Estimated | — | — |
| Token usage | Unknown | Shared Wave 2 total (see foundation-02) | Unknown / Unknown (per-node) | — | — |
| Complexity | S (reduced, no distinct re-estimate issued) | S (held) | Derived / Derived | 0 | 0% |

**Note:** the DAG's foundation-04 row was never re-issued with a reduced-scope estimate after `clock`/`idgen` were pulled forward into `foundation-01`. Comparing the stale 6-files/150-LOC full-scope number against the actual reduced-scope (`internal/lock`-only) output would compute a misleading error and is deliberately not reported as a percentage. This gap is itself a finding — see §2.

## 2. Aggregate statistics (files and LOC only — the only metrics with complete paired data)

| Metric | Value | Provenance |
|---|---|---|
| Nodes with a fully paired (estimate + independently observed actual) files-changed comparison | 17 of 19 (all except foundation-04's stale-estimate case and predictor-05/06's non-independently-split case) | Derived |
| Mean absolute files-changed error | 2.06 files | Derived, computed over the 17 comparable rows |
| Mean % files-changed error | 54.4% | Derived, same 17 rows |
| Median % files-changed error | 33.3% | Derived |
| Direction of files-changed error | 14 of 17 rows actual > estimated (under-estimation); 2 rows actual < estimated; 1 row exact match | Derived |
| Mean % LOC error (rows with a valid comparison) | 108.9% | Derived, computed over 13 rows with a clean per-node LOC pairing (excludes combined-commit and non-split rows) |
| Direction of LOC error | 13 of 13 comparable rows: actual > estimated (100% under-estimation direction) | Derived |
| Nodes where `estimated_duration` exists at all | 0 of 19 | Observed (absence) |
| Nodes where `estimated_token_usage` exists at all | 0 of 19 | Observed (absence) |
| Nodes where `actual_duration` is a real self-report (not "Unknown"/"not tracked") | 9 of 19 | Observed |
| Nodes where `actual_token_usage` is Observed at any granularity (incl. shared-invocation totals) | 17 of 19 (all except Bootstrap, executed inline with no isolated usage block) | Observed |
| Nodes where `actual_token_usage` is Observed at **per-node** granularity | 2 of 19 (`foundation-01`, `checkpoint-b03` — the only two nodes that were the sole node in their teammate's invocation) | Observed |

## 3. What this report does NOT claim

- It does not compute a token-usage error, because no token estimate ever
  existed to compare against (§0). Any number here would be fabricated.
- It does not compute a duration error for the same reason.
- The LOC "estimate" in the DAG is a single number with no documented
  definition (gross insertions? net lines? implementation only, or
  implementation + tests?). This report treats it as comparable to git's
  "insertions" count, which is the closest available analog, but this is
  an interpretive choice, not a defined equivalence — flagged explicitly
  rather than silently assumed to be exact.
- Complexity "error" is not quantified numerically (XS/S/M/L/XL is an
  ordinal label, not a cardinal scale) — §1 reports whether the label was
  held, and Calibration_Report.md (Phase 3.2) discusses direction.
