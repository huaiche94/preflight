# foundation — Progress Artifact

## Handoff notes (Constitution §6.7 / agents/foundation.md "Handoff")

- **DB constructor**: not yet built. Deferred to foundation-05
  (`internal/storage/sqlite/db.go`), out of scope for this wave.
- **Transaction API**: not yet built. Deferred to foundation-05/06;
  must conform to `app.TxRunner.WithTx` frozen in `internal/app/ports.go`.
- **Migration naming convention**: not yet decided in code (no migration
  files exist yet). `CONTRACT_FREEZE.md` fixes foundation's numeric range
  as 0000-0009; the `NNNN_description.sql` filename shape referenced by
  `agents/foundation.md`'s exclusive-paths glob
  (`internal/storage/sqlite/migrations/0000-0009_*.sql`) is the only
  naming detail frozen so far. Deferred to foundation-06.
- **Dependency requests**: none outstanding. `go.mod` now carries
  `github.com/google/uuid` (UUIDv7 IDGenerator), `github.com/spf13/cobra`
  (CLI), and `go.yaml.in/yaml/v3` (YAML config load — promoted from an
  indirect cobra dependency to a direct one in foundation-03; same API
  surface as the well-known `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`). No other role has
  requested a new dependency via its progress artifact as of this commit.
- **Config precedence/merge algorithm** (foundation-03): `internal/config.Load`
  takes an unordered slice of `Layer{Source, Bytes}` and merges them in the
  fixed order from ADD §26.1 (defaults < global_user_config < repo_config <
  repo_local < environment < cli_flags), regardless of caller-supplied
  order. Merge is a shallow top-level-key replace, not a recursive deep
  merge — no section has a typed, consumed shape yet to design a deep-merge
  algorithm against. `Config.Raw` is the generic decoded map; roles needing
  a specific section decode it themselves once they have a real consumer.
  `schema_version` must equal `preflight.config.v1` or Load errors.
  Unknown top-level fields warn by default and are collected in
  `Config.UnknownFields`; `Options.UnknownFieldPolicy = StrictUnknownFields`
  turns that into a Load error instead (ADD §26.2).

next_action: foundation-02 (blocked - not started this wave; OS-correct config/data/cache/runtime paths)
assumptions:
  - "internal/buildinfo.Version is a hardcoded \"0.0.0-dev\" string constant,
    not wired to ldflags/git describe. agents/foundation.md explicitly
    permits this for foundation-01 (\"a hardcoded ... is fine ... do not
    over-build\"); real release versioning is out of scope until release
    packaging (also explicitly out of scope per agents/foundation.md)."
  - "UUIDv7 chosen via github.com/google/uuid's NewV7(), matching
    CONTRACT_FREEZE.md's \"UUIDv7 at generation time (owned by foundation's
    internal/idgen)\" requirement. No alternative UUIDv7 library was
    evaluated since google/uuid is the de facto standard Go UUID package
    and already satisfies the requirement."
  - "Cobra was chosen over a plain flag-based stub per the task instruction
    (\"a stub preflight version command using Cobra now is preferable\")
    and matches Preflight_ADD.md's tech-stack table (CLI: Cobra, line ~192)."
  - "cmd/preflight/main_test.go was added even though agents/foundation.md's
    Required Tests list only names \"version command\" abstractly with no
    file path — treated as satisfying that requirement without needing a
    separate internal/cli package, since runtime (not foundation) owns the
    real CLI surface later (internal/cli per the DAG's runtime-b01)."

commit: 2820015
next_action: foundation-03 (YAML config load and precedence)
assumptions:
  - "internal/paths resolves only the GLOBAL, non-repository-local
    directories (config/data/cache/runtime under the user's home or OS
    convention). Repository-local .preflight/config.yaml,
    .preflight/*.db, .preflight/checkpoints/, .preflight/runtime/ (ADD
    §26.3) are NOT resolved by this package — those are relative to a
    repository root, which is a different role's concern (repository
    scoping is out of scope for foundation per agents/foundation.md).
    This package supplies the \"global user config\" layer named in
    ADD §26.1's precedence chain and the base dirs a future
    repository-scoping helper can join a repo path onto."
  - "Env is a 2-method interface (Getenv, UserHomeDir) covering only what
    path resolution needs — deliberately not a full os.Getenv/os.Environ
    wrapper, to avoid over-widening per Constitution §4's God-interface
    warning (by analogy from the provider-interface rule)."
  - "Linux and all other non-darwin/non-windows GOOS values are resolved
    via one shared XDG Base Directory implementation (XDG_CONFIG_HOME /
    XDG_DATA_HOME / XDG_CACHE_HOME / XDG_RUNTIME_DIR with documented
    fallbacks), since Preflight's portability goal is POSIX-general, not
    Linux-only, and no ADD text calls out per-BSD path differences."
  - "macOS has no OS convention distinct from XDG_CONFIG_HOME for
    'config' vs 'data'; both map to ~/Library/Application Support/preflight,
    matching common Go CLI practice on macOS. No XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
    equivalent exists on macOS or when XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is unset on Linux;
    both fall back to a `run/` subdirectory of the cache dir."
  - "Windows paths are joined with a literal backslash via a small
    winJoin helper, NOT filepath.Join/path.Join — filepath.Join's
    separator follows the host GOOS (would silently produce forward
    slashes when the Windows-path-table test runs on macOS/Linux CI
    runners), and path.Join is hardcoded to forward slash. This was
    caught by the required Windows/macOS/Linux path-table tests
    (agents/foundation.md \"Required tests\") failing on first run on
    this darwin dev host, exactly the scenario the DAG's foundation-02
    risk note (\"Windows path behavior needs CI matrix\") anticipated —
    resolved without needing a CI matrix because the test fakes GOOS
    input rather than relying on the host's actual OS."
  - "No PREFLIGHT_* environment variable convention for overriding these
    directories is introduced yet (e.g. no PREFLIGHT_CONFIG_DIR) — ADD
    and CONTRACT_FREEZE.md do not name one, and inventing one now would
    be speculative surface agents/foundation.md's Constitution §7 rule 10
    (no abstractions a later milestone would need but this one doesn't)
    warns against. CLI flag / env overrides at the config-precedence
    level are foundation-03's concern (ADD §26.1), not this package's."

commit: 0164673
next_action: foundation-04, reduced scope (internal/lock only)
assumptions:
  - "Deliberately did NOT model ADD §26.4's full default-configuration tree
    (runtime/privacy/prediction/risk/state_checkpointing/
    repository_checkpoint/graceful_pause) as typed Go structs. As of this
    node zero packages in this repository read a single config field —
    predictor/policy/checkpoint/runtime business logic does not exist yet
    and is explicitly out of scope for foundation. Inventing typed structs
    for fields nothing consumes would violate Constitution §7 rule 10.
    Instead, Config.Raw is a generic decoded map; section names from ADD
    §26.4 are registered in knownTopLevelFields ONLY for unknown-field
    detection (so a real, ADD-documented section name is never flagged as
    unknown), without validating any section's internal shape. A later
    role that actually consumes a section (e.g. predictor reading
    `prediction:`) decodes Raw[\"prediction\"] into its own typed struct
    at that point — this package does not pre-guess that shape."
  - "Merge semantics are a shallow top-level-key replace, not a recursive
    deep merge. Example: if defaults sets `runtime: {a: 1, b: 2}` and
    repo_config sets `runtime: {a: 9}`, the merged result is `runtime: {a:
    9}` — b is dropped, not preserved — because repo_config's `runtime`
    key fully replaces defaults' `runtime` key. This is a real,
    documented limitation, not an oversight: no section has a concrete,
    consumed shape yet to design and test a correct deep-merge algorithm
    against, and building one speculatively risks getting the merge
    semantics wrong for a shape that doesn't exist yet. Flagged here per
    Constitution §4.4 so a future role (or contract-integrator) can
    request deep merge explicitly once a section actually needs it."
  - "go.yaml.in/yaml/v3 (not gopkg.in/yaml.v3) was already present as an
    indirect dependency of spf13/cobra and was promoted to a direct
    top-level dependency via `go mod tidy` rather than adding a second,
    competing YAML library. It is the actively maintained successor with
    an API-compatible surface to gopkg.in/yaml.v3 (same package name
    `yaml`, same Marshal/Unmarshal signatures)."
  - "LoadFile treats a missing file as an empty Layer (not an error),
    matching ADD §26.1: every layer below CLI flags/environment (global
    user config, repo config, repo local config) is optional. Callers
    that need to distinguish 'file legitimately absent' from 'path wrong'
    do so before calling LoadFile; this package does not guess intent."
  - "No CLI wiring (`preflight config show/validate`) was added — ADD's
    CLI/API section places those commands under `runtime`'s ownership
    (agents/foundation.md: 'the runtime role owns user-facing commands'),
    and foundation-03's own DAG row scope is the load/precedence library
    only."

scope_note: >
  REDUCED SCOPE per task instruction. The DAG's original foundation-04 row
  ("Clock/IDGen/lock impls") is only partially this node's work: clock and
  idgen were already fully implemented under foundation-01 in Wave 1 (see
  that node's log above) and are NOT touched or reimplemented here. This
  node's actual new work is internal/lock only.

commit: 1ce3c50
next_action: foundation-05 (SQLite engine)
assumptions:
  - "No Lock interface/type is frozen anywhere in internal/domain or
    internal/app/ports.go (confirmed by grep before starting this node) —
    the exact lock mechanism was explicitly foundation's call per the task
    instruction ('your call on the exact mechanism'). Chose a PID-file-
    style advisory lock (os.O_EXCL exclusive create + PID contents), not
    an OS-level flock/LockFileEx syscall, because: (1) it needs zero new
    dependencies (no golang.org/x/sys), (2) Preflight_ADD.md SS1.4 fixes
    the runtime architecture as a single-machine 'modular monolith', so
    only same-machine, not networked, mutual exclusion is required, and
    (3) it is trivially crash-recoverable (see next bullet), which matters
    more for a local daemon that can be killed at any point mid-turn than
    strict kernel-enforced exclusivity would."
  - "Stale-lock recovery: if a lock file exists but its recorded PID is not
    a live process, Acquire treats it as abandoned (e.g. left behind by a
    crashed daemon), removes it, and reacquires fresh rather than wedging
    the machine forever. This is a deliberate crash-safety property, not a
    weakening of the lock's guarantee — a purely kernel-level flock would
    give this for free (locks release automatically when the holding
    process dies), but the chosen O_EXCL design needed it built explicitly
    since a plain file's existence otherwise persists across a crash."
  - "processAlive is platform-specific (process_unix.go / process_windows.go
    via build tags) because POSIX and Windows have fundamentally different
    liveness-check primitives: POSIX uses the null signal (kill(pid, 0))
    since os.FindProcess never fails on POSIX; Windows' os.FindProcess
    actually opens a process handle and fails if the PID does not exist,
    so success alone is sufficient there. Both files build cleanly on
    darwin (this dev host) via the !windows/windows build constraints;
    the windows-tagged file's correctness rests on documented Go stdlib
    behavior (verified against Go's os package docs) since it cannot be
    exercised on this darwin host without a Windows CI matrix (`qa-01`)."
  - "internal/lock intentionally does not integrate with internal/storage/
    sqlite (foundation-05, not yet built) or wire an actual daemon
    single-instance guard into cmd/preflight — that wiring belongs to
    whichever later node actually starts a long-lived daemon process
    (runtime role, out of scope for foundation per agents/foundation.md).
    This node delivers the reusable primitive only."
