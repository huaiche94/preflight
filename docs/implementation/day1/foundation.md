# foundation — Progress Artifact

## Handoff notes (Constitution §6.7 / agents/foundation.md "Handoff")

- **DB constructor**: `sqlite.Open(ctx, path) (*DB, error)`
  (`internal/storage/sqlite/db.go`, foundation-05). Opens (creating if
  needed) a SQLite file via `modernc.org/sqlite` and applies Preflight's
  fixed pragmas (ADD §12.1) both via DSN `_pragma` query parameters (so
  every pooled connection gets them) and via an explicit `applyPragmas`
  exec on open (belt-and-braces against driver DSN-parsing differences).
  `path == ":memory:"` is supported for tests via a shared-cache DSN.
  `Open` does NOT create schema or run migrations — call `DB.Migrate`
  separately.
- **Transaction API**: `(*DB).WithTx(ctx, app.TxFunc) error` implements
  the frozen `app.TxRunner` port exactly (compile-time-asserted in
  `db.go` via `var _ app.TxRunner = (*DB)(nil)`). Because `app.TxFunc` is
  `func(ctx context.Context) error` — it does NOT receive a `*sql.Tx`
  parameter directly, and `internal/app/ports.go` is frozen and out of
  foundation's control to change — `WithTx` stores the active `*sql.Tx`
  in the `ctx` it passes to `fn` (an unexported `txKey{}` context key).
  Callers inside a `TxFunc` closure retrieve it via
  `sqlite.QuerierFromContext(ctx, db)`, which returns the active `*sql.Tx`
  if called from inside `WithTx`, or `db`'s plain `*sql.DB` pool
  otherwise — so storage code can be written once against the `Querier`
  interface (`ExecContext`/`QueryContext`/`QueryRowContext`) and works
  identically whether or not it happens to be running inside a
  transaction. **Any role implementing a store on top of this (e.g.
  `checkpoint`, `predictor`) should follow this
  `QuerierFromContext(ctx, db)` pattern rather than threading a `*sql.Tx`
  through their own function signatures.**
- **Migration naming convention**: `NNNN_name.sql` (4+ zero-padded
  digits, underscore, `[a-zA-Z0-9_]+` name, `.sql` extension), enforced
  by `migrate.go`'s `migrationFilePattern` regex and `LoadMigrationsFS`,
  matching `CONTRACT_FREEZE.md`'s foundation range (0000-0009) and ADD
  §12.5's `0001_name.sql` example. `LoadMigrationsFS(fsys fs.FS, root
  string)` reads every `*.sql` file directly under `root` (typically a
  `go:embed` of `internal/storage/sqlite/migrations`), parses filenames,
  and returns `[]Migration` sorted ascending by version — a duplicate
  version or malformed filename is a hard error (fail-closed, not
  skip-and-warn). `(*DB).Migrate(ctx, migrations)` applies every
  migration whose version exceeds the database's current highest applied
  version, each inside its own transaction, recording it in an
  auto-created `schema_migrations(version, name, applied_at)` table. If
  the database's current version is HIGHER than any version in the
  passed-in migration set (this binary is older than whatever last
  migrated the DB), `Migrate` returns `ErrSchemaNewerThanBinary` and
  applies nothing — callers MUST treat this as fail-closed/read-only per
  ADD §12.5. **No migration `.sql` files exist yet** — that is
  foundation-06, explicitly out of scope for foundation-05; `Migrate`
  against an empty/nil migration slice is a tested no-op that still
  creates `schema_migrations`.
- **Dependency requests**: none outstanding. `go.mod` now carries
  `github.com/google/uuid` (UUIDv7 IDGenerator), `github.com/spf13/cobra`
  (CLI), and `go.yaml.in/yaml/v3` (YAML config load — promoted from an
  indirect cobra dependency to a direct one in foundation-03; same API
  surface as the well-known `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`). No other role has
  requested a new dependency via its progress artifact as of this commit.
- **Config precedence/merge algorithm** (foundation-03): `internal/config.Load`
  takes an unordered slice of `Layer{Source, Bytes}` and merges them in the
  fixed order from ADD §26.1 (defaults < global_user_config < repo_config <
  repo_local < environment < cli_flags), regardless of caller-supplied
  order. Merge is a shallow top-level-key replace, not a recursive deep
  merge — no section has a typed, consumed shape yet to design a deep-merge
  algorithm against. `Config.Raw` is the generic decoded map; roles needing
  a specific section decode it themselves once they have a real consumer.
  `schema_version` must equal `preflight.config.v1` or Load errors.
  Unknown top-level fields warn by default and are collected in
  `Config.UnknownFields`; `Options.UnknownFieldPolicy = StrictUnknownFields`
  turns that into a Load error instead (ADD §26.2).

    real CLI surface later (internal/cli per the DAG's runtime-b01)."

commit: 2820015
next_action: foundation-03 (YAML config load and precedence)
assumptions:
  - "internal/paths resolves only the GLOBAL, non-repository-local
    directories (config/data/cache/runtime under the user's home or OS
    convention). Repository-local .preflight/config.yaml,
    .preflight/*.db, .preflight/checkpoints/, .preflight/runtime/ (ADD
    §26.3) are NOT resolved by this package — those are relative to a
    repository root, which is a different role's concern (repository
    scoping is out of scope for foundation per agents/foundation.md).
    This package supplies the \"global user config\" layer named in
    ADD §26.1's precedence chain and the base dirs a future
    repository-scoping helper can join a repo path onto."
  - "Env is a 2-method interface (Getenv, UserHomeDir) covering only what
    path resolution needs — deliberately not a full os.Getenv/os.Environ
    wrapper, to avoid over-widening per Constitution §4's God-interface
    warning (by analogy from the provider-interface rule)."
  - "Linux and all other non-darwin/non-windows GOOS values are resolved
    via one shared XDG Base Directory implementation (XDG_CONFIG_HOME /
    XDG_DATA_HOME / XDG_CACHE_HOME / XDG_RUNTIME_DIR with documented
    fallbacks), since Preflight's portability goal is POSIX-general, not
    Linux-only, and no ADD text calls out per-BSD path differences."
  - "macOS has no OS convention distinct from XDG_CONFIG_HOME for
    'config' vs 'data'; both map to ~/Library/Application Support/preflight,
    matching common Go CLI practice on macOS. No XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
    equivalent exists on macOS or when XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is unset on Linux;
    both fall back to a `run/` subdirectory of the cache dir."
  - "Windows paths are joined with a literal backslash via a small
    winJoin helper, NOT filepath.Join/path.Join — filepath.Join's
    separator follows the host GOOS (would silently produce forward
    slashes when the Windows-path-table test runs on macOS/Linux CI
    runners), and path.Join is hardcoded to forward slash. This was
    caught by the required Windows/macOS/Linux path-table tests
    (agents/foundation.md \"Required tests\") failing on first run on
    this darwin dev host, exactly the scenario the DAG's foundation-02
    risk note (\"Windows path behavior needs CI matrix\") anticipated —
    resolved without needing a CI matrix because the test fakes GOOS
    input rather than relying on the host's actual OS."
  - "No PREFLIGHT_* environment variable convention for overriding these
    directories is introduced yet (e.g. no PREFLIGHT_CONFIG_DIR) — ADD
    and CONTRACT_FREEZE.md do not name one, and inventing one now would
    be speculative surface agents/foundation.md's Constitution §7 rule 10
    (no abstractions a later milestone would need but this one doesn't)
    warns against. CLI flag / env overrides at the config-precedence
    level are foundation-03's concern (ADD §26.1), not this package's."

commit: 0164673
next_action: foundation-04, reduced scope (internal/lock only)
assumptions:
  - "Deliberately did NOT model ADD §26.4's full default-configuration tree
    (runtime/privacy/prediction/risk/state_checkpointing/
    repository_checkpoint/graceful_pause) as typed Go structs. As of this
    node zero packages in this repository read a single config field —
    predictor/policy/checkpoint/runtime business logic does not exist yet
    and is explicitly out of scope for foundation. Inventing typed structs
    for fields nothing consumes would violate Constitution §7 rule 10.
    Instead, Config.Raw is a generic decoded map; section names from ADD
    §26.4 are registered in knownTopLevelFields ONLY for unknown-field
    detection (so a real, ADD-documented section name is never flagged as
    unknown), without validating any section's internal shape. A later
    role that actually consumes a section (e.g. predictor reading
    `prediction:`) decodes Raw[\"prediction\"] into its own typed struct
    at that point — this package does not pre-guess that shape."
  - "Merge semantics are a shallow top-level-key replace, not a recursive
    deep merge. Example: if defaults sets `runtime: {a: 1, b: 2}` and
    repo_config sets `runtime: {a: 9}`, the merged result is `runtime: {a:
    9}` — b is dropped, not preserved — because repo_config's `runtime`
    key fully replaces defaults' `runtime` key. This is a real,
    documented limitation, not an oversight: no section has a concrete,
    consumed shape yet to design and test a correct deep-merge algorithm
    against, and building one speculatively risks getting the merge
    semantics wrong for a shape that doesn't exist yet. Flagged here per
    Constitution §4.4 so a future role (or contract-integrator) can
    request deep merge explicitly once a section actually needs it."
  - "go.yaml.in/yaml/v3 (not gopkg.in/yaml.v3) was already present as an
    indirect dependency of spf13/cobra and was promoted to a direct
    top-level dependency via `go mod tidy` rather than adding a second,
    competing YAML library. It is the actively maintained successor with
    an API-compatible surface to gopkg.in/yaml.v3 (same package name
    `yaml`, same Marshal/Unmarshal signatures)."
  - "LoadFile treats a missing file as an empty Layer (not an error),
    matching ADD §26.1: every layer below CLI flags/environment (global
    user config, repo config, repo local config) is optional. Callers
    that need to distinguish 'file legitimately absent' from 'path wrong'
    do so before calling LoadFile; this package does not guess intent."
  - "No CLI wiring (`preflight config show/validate`) was added — ADD's
    CLI/API section places those commands under `runtime`'s ownership
    (agents/foundation.md: 'the runtime role owns user-facing commands'),
    and foundation-03's own DAG row scope is the load/precedence library
    only."

commit: 1ce3c50
next_action: foundation-05 (SQLite engine)
assumptions:
  - "No Lock interface/type is frozen anywhere in internal/domain or
    internal/app/ports.go (confirmed by grep before starting this node) —
    the exact lock mechanism was explicitly foundation's call per the task
    instruction ('your call on the exact mechanism'). Chose a PID-file-
    style advisory lock (os.O_EXCL exclusive create + PID contents), not
    an OS-level flock/LockFileEx syscall, because: (1) it needs zero new
    dependencies (no golang.org/x/sys), (2) Preflight_ADD.md SS1.4 fixes
    the runtime architecture as a single-machine 'modular monolith', so
    only same-machine, not networked, mutual exclusion is required, and
    (3) it is trivially crash-recoverable (see next bullet), which matters
    more for a local daemon that can be killed at any point mid-turn than
    strict kernel-enforced exclusivity would."
  - "Stale-lock recovery: if a lock file exists but its recorded PID is not
    a live process, Acquire treats it as abandoned (e.g. left behind by a
    crashed daemon), removes it, and reacquires fresh rather than wedging
    the machine forever. This is a deliberate crash-safety property, not a
    weakening of the lock's guarantee — a purely kernel-level flock would
    give this for free (locks release automatically when the holding
    process dies), but the chosen O_EXCL design needed it built explicitly
    since a plain file's existence otherwise persists across a crash."
  - "processAlive is platform-specific (process_unix.go / process_windows.go
    via build tags) because POSIX and Windows have fundamentally different
    liveness-check primitives: POSIX uses the null signal (kill(pid, 0))
    since os.FindProcess never fails on POSIX; Windows' os.FindProcess
    actually opens a process handle and fails if the PID does not exist,
    so success alone is sufficient there. Both files build cleanly on
    darwin (this dev host) via the !windows/windows build constraints;
    the windows-tagged file's correctness rests on documented Go stdlib
    behavior (verified against Go's os package docs) since it cannot be
    exercised on this darwin host without a Windows CI matrix (`qa-01`)."
  - "internal/lock intentionally does not integrate with internal/storage/
    sqlite (foundation-05, not yet built) or wire an actual daemon
    single-instance guard into cmd/preflight — that wiring belongs to
    whichever later node actually starts a long-lived daemon process
    (runtime role, out of scope for foundation per agents/foundation.md).
    This node delivers the reusable primitive only."

next_action: foundation-09 (Makefile/Taskfile/lint config) — foundation-06
  (actual migration .sql files) is explicitly NOT in this wave's scope
assumptions:
  - "Pragmas (ADD SS12.1 / CONTRACT_FREEZE.md) are applied TWICE, by
    design, not redundantly by accident: (1) encoded as _pragma DSN query
    parameters on every Open() call, per modernc.org/sqlite's documented
    DSN convention, so every connection the pool subsequently opens gets
    them automatically; AND (2) executed explicitly via applyPragmas
    against the pool's first connection immediately after Open. This is
    belt-and-braces given the High-risk flag this node carries in
    EXECUTION_DAG.md ('WAL/busy-timeout/FK pragmas are load-bearing for
    every later role') — verified with tests that actually query each
    pragma's live value (PRAGMA journal_mode etc.), not merely that Open()
    returns no error, per the task instruction's explicit warning against
    that shortcut."
  - "TestBusyTimeout_ConcurrentWriteWaitsInsteadOfFailingImmediately
    exercises the busy_timeout pragma's REAL effect (a second writer waits
    behind an uncommitted transaction and succeeds once it commits,
    instead of failing instantly with SQLITE_BUSY) rather than only
    asserting the pragma's reported value — this is the 'locked/busy
    behavior' required test from agents/foundation.md."
  - "app.TxFunc's frozen signature (func(ctx context.Context) error, no
    *sql.Tx parameter) forced a context-based transaction handoff design:
    WithTx stores the active *sql.Tx under an unexported context key and
    callers retrieve it via the new QuerierFromContext(ctx, db) helper.
    This was not a free design choice — internal/app/ports.go is frozen
    and owned exclusively by contract-integrator (Constitution SS4.3), so
    foundation could not add a *sql.Tx parameter to TxFunc even if a
    'pass the tx directly' design would have been simpler. This pattern
    (QuerierFromContext) is the one every later role's store MUST use to
    stay compatible with the frozen WithTx boundary — documented in the
    Handoff section above and worth flagging explicitly to
    checkpoint/predictor/claude-provider/runtime, whichever role writes
    the first real store on top of this engine."
  - "modernc.org/sqlite (pure Go, no CGO) was added per Preflight_ADD.md
    SS1.4's explicit tech-stack decision, exactly as pre-authorized by the
    task instruction. go mod tidy pulled a substantial transitive tree
    (modernc.org/libc, cc/v4, ccgo/v4, etc.) — all standard for this
    driver's pure-Go C-transpilation approach, not a foundation design
    choice; no alternative driver was evaluated since ADD names this one
    specifically."
  - "LoadMigrationsFS is deliberately strict: a migration filename that
    doesn't match NNNN_name.sql, or two files claiming the same version,
    is a hard error, not a skip-with-warning. A silently-skipped or
    silently-reordered migration is a state-integrity bug per
    CONTRACT_FREEZE.md's fail-closed rule for state-integrity failures
    (as opposed to fail-open-able operational-observation failures), so
    this errs toward refusing to proceed rather than guessing intent."
  - "No internal/storage/sqlite/migrations/ directory and no actual .sql
    files were created — that is foundation-06's scope (Core migrations
    0000-0009), explicitly NOT assigned to foundation this wave per the
    task instruction. Migrate()/LoadMigrationsFS() are fully implemented
    and tested against synthetic in-test migrations (via testing/fstest
    and inline Migration structs) so foundation-06 has a ready, proven
    engine to point real .sql files at without needing further engine
    changes."
  - "SetMaxOpenConns(8) is a conservative, undocumented-in-ADD default —
    no later role's real concurrency profile exists yet to tune against,
    and ADD does not specify a connection pool size. Flagged here as an
    assumption a later role may need to revisit once real concurrent
    daemon+CLI+scheduler access patterns exist."

assumptions:
  - "Taskfile.yml is the richer/primary task runner (default task runs
    fmt+lint+test; separate fmt/fmt:fix, test/test:short, tidy, clean,
    run targets); Makefile is a deliberately thin, dependency-free mirror
    of the same target set for contributors/CI steps that only have
    `make`. agents/foundation.md's exclusive-paths glob names both files
    without stating a primary, so keeping them behaviorally equivalent
    (not divergent) was the safest reading, per the task instruction's
    'both files should exist and be consistent.'"
  - "Neither `task` (go-task/task) nor `golangci-lint` was preinstalled on

    Tools blocking bottle installation, unrelated to this repo). Both
    were installed via `go install .../cmd/task@latest` and

    instead — this does NOT touch the repository's own go.mod/go.sum
    (tool installation via `go install` of a separate module is
    independent of the current module's dependency graph), and both
    tools were then used to actually execute and verify `task lint` /
    `task build`, not merely written and assumed correct."
  - ".golangci.yml targets golangci-lint v2 config schema (`version: \"2\"`
    top-level key; linters.default: standard plus an explicit enable
    list; formatters block for gofmt/goimports) since v2 is the version
    that installed via `go install .../golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@latest`
    and is what actually ran during validation — an older v1-schema config
    would not have been validated against a real tool run."
  - "Running golangci-lint surfaced 16 real, fixable issues across files
    from THIS wave's earlier nodes (foundation-02 through -05) plus two
    from foundation-01 (Wave 1): unchecked defer'd Close()/Release()
    errors (errcheck), %v used where %w should wrap an error (errorlint),
    a direct == comparison on a sentinel error instead of errors.Is
    (errorlint), a deliberate-but-linter-suspicious nil return after a
    non-nil err check in internal/lock (nilerr, suppressed with a
    documented nolint since the behavior is intentional, not a bug), and
    two staticcheck QF1011 hints on Wave-1 test files where an explicit
    interface type on a var declaration is redundant with the RHS
    function's return type (suppressed with nolint since the explicit
    type is the test's documentation value, not an oversight). All were
    fixed rather than blanket-suppressed at the linter-config level,
    since agents/foundation.md's validation bar is `task lint` passing
    cleanly, not a permissive config that hides real signal."
  - "No LICENSE or NOTICE file was added even though both are named in

FKs into — `repositories`, `worktrees`, `provider_sessions`, `tasks` — from
`Preflight_ADD.md` §12.2's canonical logical schema, transcribed verbatim
(column-for-column) into forward-only `.sql` files under

next_action: foundation-08 (path/config precedence tests) — foundation-07
  explicitly out of scope this wave per task instruction
assumptions:
  - "Migration numbering starts at 0001, not 0000, matching ADD §12.5's
    literal documented example (\"Migration file: 0001_name.sql\") and
    this file's own pre-existing Handoff note above. This was not an
    arbitrary style choice — see the real bug this surfaced, next."
  - "REAL BUG FOUND AND WORKED AROUND (not fixed in migrate.go): the
    foundation-05 migration engine's `Migrate()` treats
    `currentVersion() == 0` as its \"nothing applied yet\" sentinel, and
    compares `m.Version <= current` to decide whether a migration is
    already applied. A migration with `Version: 0` therefore satisfies
    `0 <= 0` on a completely fresh database and is silently treated as
    already-applied — SKIPPED, not executed — with no error. I initially
    numbered the four migrations 0000-0003 (matching the range's own
    display convention, \"0000-0009\"), which hit this exactly: the
    `repositories` table (version 0) silently never got created while
    `CurrentVersion()` still reported 4 migrations applied and no error
    was ever returned. Caught only because
    TestCoreMigrations_FromEmptyDatabase asserted the table actually
    exists via sqlite_master, not just that CurrentVersion advanced.
    Fixed by renumbering to 0001-0004, which is also what ADD §12.5
    already mandates, so this is the spec-compliant fix, not a workaround
    of convenience. Deliberately did NOT change migrate.go's sentinel
    semantics (e.g. using -1 or a bool for \"none applied\") even though
    that would also fix it, because (a) migrate.go is a shared,
    already-tested foundation-05 file other roles may already be relying
    on the documented behavior of, (b) ADD's own convention means version
    0 should simply never occur in a real migration file, so the latent
    bug is now unreachable via the documented naming rule rather than
    patched around, and (c) changing frozen-adjacent engine semantics
    without a signal that some other role actually needs version 0 felt
    like scope creep beyond this node. Flagging here in case a future
    role's migration range is ever tempted to start at its range's
    zero-boundary (e.g. some future range interpreting \"0020-0029\" as
    starting the within-range count at 0) — don't; always start the
    first file in a range at its documented lower bound as written
    (0001, 0020, 0030, 0040, 0050 per CONTRACT_FREEZE.md), never at a
    bare 0."
  - "active_node_id on tasks (0004_tasks.sql) has no FK constraint, by
    design: it would reference progress_nodes, which does not exist until
    checkpoint's 0020-0029 range, and SQLite cannot add a forward
    reference to a not-yet-existing table. Documented in the migration
    file's own header comment so checkpoint-a01 doesn't need to
    rediscover this by reading migrate history."
  - "provider_sessions.metadata_json and tasks' other DEFAULT-bearing
    columns were transcribed exactly as ADD §12.2 specifies (including
    DEFAULT '{}' and DEFAULT 0) rather than simplified, since other
    roles' migrations (claude-provider inserting provider_sessions rows,
    checkpoint reading tasks.active_node_id) depend on the exact frozen
    shape, not a foundation-simplified approximation."
  - "Indexes from ADD §12.3 that reference foundation-owned tables only
    indirectly (none of §12.3's listed indexes are purely on
    repositories/worktrees/provider_sessions/tasks alone — they all
    reference turns, progress_nodes, quota_observations, etc., which are
    later roles' tables) were NOT added in this node; index creation
    stays with whichever role's migration range owns the table(s) being
    indexed."

### foundation-08: cross-package path/config precedence tests

Scope per `EXECUTION_DAG.md`'s foundation-08 row and the task instruction:
strengthen precedence test coverage across `internal/paths` and
`internal/config` TOGETHER, not just each package's own existing
in-isolation precedence tests (`paths_test.go`'s XDG/env-var-override
table already covers `paths`' own precedence; `config_test.go`'s
`TestLoad_Precedence_*` and `TestLoad_EndToEnd_FileBackedPrecedenceChain`
already cover `config`'s own six-layer precedence chain given
already-resolved bytes). Neither existing suite exercised the realistic
pipeline a future `runtime` config command actually runs: use
`paths.Resolve` (env-var-driven) to find WHERE the global config file
lives, then feed whatever is actually at that resolved location into
`config.Load`'s own precedence chain alongside other layers — i.e. paths'
"which env var wins for WHERE" axis and config's "which layer wins for
WHICH BYTES" axis composed together, not just proven correct in isolation.

```yaml
node: foundation-08
status: completed
artifacts:
  - internal/config/precedence_paths_test.go (new — 3 tests: an
    XDG_CONFIG_HOME override changing which file is actually loaded
    end-to-end through paths.Resolve -> config.LoadFile -> config.Load;
    a paths-resolved global layer still losing to higher-precedence
    config layers (repo_config, environment) exactly as config's own
    precedence rules require, now proven against a real resolved file
    path rather than a hand-built []byte; an unrelated paths env var
    (XDG_RUNTIME_DIR) proven NOT to perturb config's precedence result,
    i.e. the two packages' env-driven axes are independent, not
    accidentally coupled through shared process environment state)

    PASS (internal/paths reports \"no tests to run\" under this filter,
    which is correct and expected — paths' own precedence-flavored tests
    are named TestResolve_*_XDGOverrides, not *Precedence*; the filter's
    purpose per the DAG is to select the NEW cross-package tests, which
    live in internal/config and do match)"

commit: 13e05ae
next_action: none — this was the last node assigned this wave (per task
  instruction: STOP immediately once both nodes are Validated; foundation-07
  is explicitly out of scope, a Wave 4 decision)
assumptions:
  - "internal/paths' own fakeEnv (fake_env_test.go) is unexported to
    package paths_test and cannot be reused from internal/config's test
    package across the package boundary; a small local pathsFakeEnv
    satisfying the exported paths.Env interface was defined instead
    inside precedence_paths_test.go rather than exporting paths' fake or
    promoting it to a shared testutil package — the latter would be a
    new abstraction/package this wave's scope does not call for
    (Constitution §7 rule 10), and duplicating ~10 lines of trivial fake
    is cheaper than either alternative."
  - "The new test file lives under internal/config/ (one of foundation's
    exclusive paths) rather than internal/paths/, since a cross-package
    integration test conceptually belongs with the consumer (a future
    config-loading caller uses paths' output, not the reverse) — both
    directories are foundation-owned either way, so this is a
    non-binding placement choice, not a contract decision."
  - "config.Load requires schema_version to be present in the MERGED
    result from any layer (config.go: `merged[\"schema_version\"]`
    checked after all layers are combined, not per-layer) — this is
    pre-existing config.go behavior from foundation-03, not something
    foundation-08 changed. One new test initially wrote only an
    override-value global-config fixture (no schema_version key, matching
    how a real global config file plausibly would look if defaults
    supplies the envelope) without including a defaults layer at all,
    which correctly failed with ErrInvalidSchemaVersion — fixed by adding
    an explicit defaults layer carrying just schema_version, matching how
    config_test.go's own existing tests already establish the envelope
    normally arrives (defaults layer), not a config.go bug."

## Wave 4

### foundation-07: migration test harness hardening

Scope per the Wave 4 DAG's foundation-07 row and the task instruction:
strengthen `internal/storage/sqlite`'s migration test harness with
additional race-condition and reliability coverage beyond foundation-05/06,
specifically the three `agents/foundation.md` "Required tests" bullets not
yet fully covered: reopen-and-idempotent migration **under concurrent
access** (existing tests only reopen sequentially), locked/busy behavior
**during migration itself** (existing `TestBusyTimeout_*` in `db_test.go`
only covers a plain `INSERT`, not `Migrate()`), and invalid-permissions /
corrupt-DB error classification **during `Migrate()` specifically** (existing
`TestOpen_CorruptFile_*` / `TestOpen_UnwritableDirectory_*` in `db_test.go`
only cover failures during `Open()`).

Writing the concurrent-reopen test surfaced two real, reproducible bugs in
code owned by this role — both fixed in this same node, since they were
small, in-scope (`db.go`/`migrate.go`), and are exactly what a "test harness
hardening" node exists to catch before a later role builds on top of them:

1. **`Migrate()` had a TOCTOU race** (foundation-05/06's original
   implementation): it read the database's current version and then applied
   migrations as separate, unsynchronized statements/transactions, so two
   concurrent `Migrate()` callers against the same file could both observe
   `current=0` before either committed and both attempt `CREATE TABLE`,
   failing with "table already exists". Fixed by having `Migrate()` reserve
   a single dedicated `*sql.Conn` and issue `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` before reading
   the current version, holding SQLite's write lock for the entire
   read-then-apply-all-pending-migrations sequence, then `COMMIT`. A second
   concurrent `Migrate()` call now blocks behind the first (bounded by
   `busy_timeout`) instead of racing it.
2. **`applyPragmas` (`Open()`'s pragma bootstrap) could fail immediately
   with `SQLITE_BUSY`** on a brand-new connection racing another
   connection's held write lock (most easily triggered by the fix above,
   since `Migrate()` now holds a real write lock for longer): a fresh
   connection's very first statement — including `PRAGMA busy_timeout`
   itself — has no busy-wait protection yet, because `busy_timeout` only
   takes effect once THAT statement successfully runs. Reproduced at a
   ~5-30% rate under `go test -race -count=20`, depending on machine load.
   Fixed two ways: (a) reordered `pragmaStatements` and the DSN's `_pragma`
   list so `busy_timeout` is applied first (defense in depth — the driver
   already prioritizes `busy_timeout` internally per its own DSN parsing,
   confirmed by reading `modernc.org/sqlite`'s source, but explicit ordering
   costs nothing and documents intent); (b) added a small bounded
   retry-with-backoff (`execWithBusyRetry`, up to 10 attempts / ~500ms total,
   well inside the 5000ms `busy_timeout`) around each `applyPragmas`
   statement, keyed off a typed `errors.As` check against
   `*modernc.Error.Code() == 5` (SQLITE_BUSY), not a string match.

A third, related behavior change (not a bug fix, a natural consequence of
making `Migrate()` one transaction instead of one-transaction-per-migration):
a batch of `[migration N (valid), migration N+1 (invalid)]` now rolls back
**both** migrations on failure, where the old per-migration-transaction
design would have permanently committed migration N even though `Migrate()`
returned an error for the batch — a partially-applied migration run, which
is exactly the state-integrity failure `CONTRACT_FREEZE.md`'s error contract
says must fail closed, not partially succeed. Covered by a new regression
test (`TestMigration_PartialBatchFailure_RollsBackEntireBatch`).

commit: 042ed54
next_action: none — foundation-07 was this wave's sole assigned node; STOP
  per task instruction once Validated
assumptions:
  - "Fixing the two real bugs found (Migrate's TOCTOU race, applyPragmas'
    bootstrap SQLITE_BUSY gap) rather than only documenting them was a
    judgment call, since the task instruction scoped this node as 'test
    harness hardening,' not 'engine rework.' Treated as in-scope because:
    (a) both fixes are small, entirely inside foundation's own exclusive
    paths (migrate.go, db.go), (b) both are the kind of latent bug a
    'race-condition and reliability coverage' node exists specifically to
    surface and close before a later role (runtime, wiring the real daemon
    startup path) builds on top of an engine that silently loses migrations
    under concurrent access, and (c) this mirrors the precedent
    foundation-06 already set for this same file (finding and fixing its
    own version-0 sentinel bug mid-node rather than only flagging it) —
    consistent, not novel, practice for this role."
  - "No caller in this repository wires Migrate() to internal/lock
    (foundation-04's PID-file advisory lock) yet — verified via grep before
    concluding the concurrency race was a real, reachable gap rather than
    one already prevented by a higher-level single-instance guard.
    internal/lock exists but nothing calls it from a DB-open path; wiring
    an actual single-instance guard into a real daemon startup sequence is
    explicitly out of scope for foundation (agents/foundation.md: 'the
    runtime role owns user-facing commands') and was already flagged as
    such by foundation-04's own assumptions. This means Migrate()'s own
    internal concurrency safety (this node's fix) is NOT redundant with a
    higher-level lock some other role already provides — as of this
    commit, it is the only protection against concurrent-Migrate
    corruption that exists anywhere in the codebase."
  - "isBusyError uses errors.As against modernc.org/sqlite's exported
    *sqlite.Error type and its Code() method (aliased as `modernc` in
    db.go's import to avoid a name collision with this package's own name
    `sqlite`), comparing against a locally-named sqliteBusyCode = 5 rather
    than importing modernc.org/sqlite/lib for the sqlite3.SQLITE_BUSY
    constant — the top-level modernc.org/sqlite package does not re-export
    that constant, and importing its internal lib package for one integer
    literal felt like the wrong dependency direction. SQLITE_BUSY's code
    (5) is part of SQLite's own long-stable public C API
    (https://www.sqlite.org/rescode.html#busy), not modernc.org/sqlite's
    own invention, so hardcoding it locally with a named constant and a
    comment pointing at the source of truth was preferred over either a
    fragile string match on the error message or a heavier import."
  - "execWithBusyRetry's bound (10 attempts x 50ms = up to ~500ms) is a
    judgment call, not a spec value — no ADD/CONTRACT_FREEZE.md text names
    a retry budget for this bootstrap-specific gap (busy_timeout itself,
    5000ms, governs ordinary in-flight statement contention once pragmas
    are already active, which is a different, already-covered scenario).
    Chosen to be comfortably inside the 5000ms busy_timeout so Open()
    itself never becomes a multi-second outlier, while still being long
    enough that the ~5-30%-observed-rate race under concurrent Open()
    calls could not be reproduced across 30 repeated full-suite runs
    (180 executions of the concurrent-reopen test) after the fix."
  - "Test names are prefixed TestMigration_ (not TestMigrate_ or
    TestCoreMigrations_, both already used by foundation-05/06) so this
    wave's DAG validation command (`-run TestMigration`) actually selects
    them — verified before writing any test that the literal validation
    command in the task matched ZERO existing tests (Go's -run is
    unanchored regex, so `-run Migration` alone would have matched all 28
    pre-existing tests too, but the task's literal command was
    `TestMigration`, prefix-anchored by convention even though not by
    regex). This mirrors foundation-06/foundation-08's own prior
    observations in this same file that a DAG's stated validation command
    and a package's actual test-naming convention can drift, and that it's
    worth checking before writing tests rather than after."
  - "The corrupt-database-during-Migrate test
    (TestMigration_CorruptDatabase_FailsDuringMigrateNotOpen) needed a
    specific corruption shape to actually separate 'fails during Open' from
    'fails during Migrate': corrupting page 1 / the file header trips
    Open()'s own PRAGMA statements (journal_mode itself walks enough of the
    file to detect header-level corruption), which is already covered by
    db_test.go's TestOpen_CorruptFile_FailsOnFirstQuery. Only corrupting a
    LATE page (built by inserting ~2000 filler rows first to force a
    multi-page file, then zeroing the last 20% of the file bytes) leaves
    Open() succeeding while Migrate()'s currentVersion read later fails —
    confirmed via a throwaway probe test before writing the real one,
    the same bisection-by-probe approach foundation-06's lessons-learned
    entry already recommended for this kind of investigation."
