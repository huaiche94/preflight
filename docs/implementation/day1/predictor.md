# Predictor — Day-1 Progress Artifact

Role packet: `agents/predictor.md`. Frozen contracts: `docs/implementation/day1/CONTRACT_FREEZE.md`.
Branch: `day1/predictor`. This wave covered exactly the root nodes unblocked by `contract-integrator`
per the frozen execution DAG: `predictor-02`, `predictor-03`, `predictor-04`.

`predictor-01` (SQLite migrations 0040-0049) is **not** in this wave — it depends on `foundation-06`
(core SQLite migration harness), which is not yet complete. Per Constitution §6/§4 and the DAG, it is
queued, not skipped, not substituted.

## Wave summary

All three assigned nodes (`predictor-02`, `predictor-03`, `predictor-04`) are `completed` with durable
artifacts (committed files) and passing validation commands, on branch `day1/predictor`, not pushed and
not merged. No work was started on `predictor-01` (blocked on `foundation-06`) or `predictor-05`
onward (blocked on this wave's nodes feeding forward into next wave), per the DAG and Constitution §6/§7.

Nothing in this wave touched `internal/policy/**` or `internal/evaluation/**` — those remain untouched,
as instructed.

## Wave 2 (predictor-05, predictor-06)

Branch: `day1/predictor`, fast-forward-merged onto `main @ 4f96d7f` (Bootstrap + Wave 1 integration +
ADR-041) by the lead before this wave started. Re-read CONSTITUTION.md, CONTRACT_FREEZE.md's

before starting, per instruction. Assigned exactly `predictor-05` and `predictor-06` this wave;
`predictor-05b`/`predictor-05c` (Token/Quota Forecaster) are explicitly out of scope, reserved for a
future wave, and were not started, stubbed, or scaffolded.

Rather than editing internal/app/ports.go (not this role's path) or guessing a DTO shape into it, RuleScopeEstimator depends on its own package-local FeatureSource interface (internal/predictor/scope/estimator.go) that a later wave's storage-backed implementation can satisfy. This is a documented assumption, not a silent contract deviation."
  - "ADD §14.6's cold-start table only names 8 of the 16 §14.3 task classes. The remaining 8 (question, inspection, test-only, bugfix-cross-layer, refactor-local, performance-investigation, security-sensitive, unknown) use a documented nearest-neighbor fallback table (internal/predictor/scope/coldstart.go's coldStartFallback) rather than inventing new ADD-table rows or leaving those classes unhandled."

  - "ToolCallsP50/P90, VerificationP50/P90, RetryLoopsP50/P90, DurationP50/P90 are left nil (no tool-call/verification-run telemetry source wired up this wave) — explicitly permitted by forecast.go's own doc comment and the DAG's stated scope for this node ('Scope estimates for files read/changed and LOC')."

assumptions:
  - "GracefulPauseService.Observe (internal/app/ports.go) is the sole frozen consumer named for domain.RunwayForecast; this wave implements the scoring function (runway.Scorer.Score) that role's Observe implementation calls into per runtime observation, not the observation loop or pause orchestration itself — no runtime/scheduling code was added, consistent with the predictor role boundary ('No provider JSON parsing, Git commands, checkpoint creation, or process interruption')."
  - "Per ADD §15.6's calibration gate (>=20 valid runway samples, held-out cohort evaluation, ECE<=0.08, Brier score recorded, model artifact calibrated=true, quota sample freshness) and the cold-start contract in agents/predictor.md, HitProbability is always nil and Calibrated is always false this wave — no durable burn-rate telemetry store exists yet (depends on claude-provider/foundation SQLite work in a later wave, exactly as ADR-041 notes for predictor-05c). RiskScore is always populated (never nil) using the ADD §15.7 uncalibrated fallback thresholds (current>=95% -> critical/1.0, projected_used_p90>=100% within horizon -> high/0.85, projected_used_p90>=95% -> medium-high/0.65, else scaled continuously by remaining headroom) so policy still has a usable, explicitly-uncalibrated signal."
  - "Scorer is stateless: it takes the current QuotaObservation plus an optional single Previous observation per call (matching GracefulPauseService.Observe's own per-call RuntimeObservation{SessionID, Quota domain.QuotaObservation} shape, one observation at a time) rather than owning durable multi-sample history itself — history storage belongs to whichever role owns the observation store, outside this role's boundary. With only one interval available, BurnRateP50 and BurnRateP90 collapse to the same single observed rate (no distribution to resample from); ADD §15.5's full N=1000-draw empirical-bootstrap simulation is the calibrated path gated by §15.6 and is deliberately not attempted this wave (Constitution §7 rule 10)."
  - "Outlier handling follows ADD §15.4 directly: negative delta => treated as reset/correction, not a negative rate; interval < 2s => not counted; rate above a conservative default sanity cap (50 percentage-points/minute; no provider-specific cap exists yet with no live telemetry wired up) => marked anomalous and dropped; sample staler than 5 minutes (chosen relative to the 10-minute default horizon; ADD does not name an exact staleness duration) => lowers Confidence rather than being dropped."
  - "Multiple simultaneous QuotaObservation limit windows are combined via CombineWindows, which takes max(RiskScore) across windows — matching ADD §15.5's explicit v1 default ('若 windows 高度相關，policy 可用保守 max(P_i)；v1 預設取 max，避免錯誤獨立假設') rather than the independence-assuming 1-Π(1-P_i) formula, which is reserved for the calibrated path."
  - "ADD §15.8 reset-awareness: when ResetsAt falls within the scored horizon, RiskScore is pulled down toward a low headroom-available value regardless of current usage/burn rate, since the window will not actually be exhausted before it resets."

## Wave 2 summary

Both assigned nodes (`predictor-05`, `predictor-06`) are `completed` with durable artifacts and passing
validation commands, on branch `day1/predictor`. `predictor-05b` (Token Forecaster) and `predictor-05c`
(Quota Forecaster) were deliberately not started — reserved for a future wave per explicit instruction,
despite `predictor-05b` nominally depending on `predictor-05` which is now done. No `RuleTokenForecaster`
or `RuleQuotaForecaster` (or anything satisfying the `TokenForecaster`/`QuotaForecaster` interfaces) was
written. No other role's paths were touched. No merge/rebase onto `main` was performed this wave (branch
was already up to date at `4f96d7f` from the lead's fast-forward merge before this wave began).

---

## Lint correction (post-Wave 2, cross-role integration pass)

A cross-role integration validation pass (`golangci-lint run` against the full merged Wave 2 tree)
surfaced 3 findings in files owned by this role. This is a corrective commit responding to those
findings, not a new DAG node — no `predictor-05b`/`predictor-05c`/`predictor-07` or other work was
started.

- `internal/predictor/runway/runway.go:120` — gocritic `appendAssign` (append result assigned to a
  different slice than the one appended to: `forecast.ReasonCodes = append(reasons, ...)`). Investigated
  whether `reasons` was reused afterward: it is declared fresh (`nil`) immediately above this branch and
  the branch returns right after this line, so there was no aliasing with later code — **cosmetic only,
  not a real bug**. Fixed by appending directly to `forecast.ReasonCodes` instead of the local `reasons`
  variable, preserving identical behavior.
- `internal/predictor/scope/estimator_test.go:64,67` — staticcheck QF1001 (De Morgan's law
  simplification). Rewrote `if !(*p50 <= *p80) {` as `if *p50 > *p80 {` and
  `if !(*p80 <= *p90) {` as `if *p80 > *p90 {`, logically identical.

validation:
  - "gofmt -l internal/predictor  # clean"
  - "go build ./internal/predictor/...  # ok"
  - "go vet ./internal/predictor/...  # ok"
  - "go test ./internal/predictor/... -race  # PASS, all packages"
  - "golangci-lint not installed in this environment; underlying gocritic/staticcheck patterns fixed per their documented rules"

Only the two named files were touched; no other role's paths were touched.

## Wave 3 (predictor-05b)

Branch: `day1/predictor`, continuing from `4285e12` (Wave 2 + lint correction), already fully merged
into `main`. Re-read CONSTITUTION.md, CONTRACT_FREEZE.md's "Predictor pipeline ports (ADR-041)"
section, `docs/adr/0041-predictor-forecast-layer.md`, `internal/domain/forecast.go`,
`internal/app/ports.go`'s ADR-041 section, `agents/predictor.md`, `Preflight_ADD.md` §15.1-15.2, and
`Preflight_Predictor_Design_Supplement.md`'s "Stage 2 — Token Prediction"/"MVP Heuristic Formula"
sections before starting, per instruction. No merge/rebase onto `main` was performed or needed —
predictor-05, predictor-04's quantile utilities, and ADR-041's frozen types were all already on this
branch. Assigned exactly `predictor-05b` (Token Forecaster) this wave; `predictor-05c` (Quota
Forecaster) and `predictor-07` (Risk Combiner) were explicitly out of scope and were not started,
stubbed, or scaffolded.

next_action: none — predictor-05b is the sole assigned Wave 3 node; predictor-05c/predictor-07 explicitly deferred per instruction; stopping here
assumptions:
  - "app.ForecastTokensRequest (frozen) carries only SessionID and the Stage-1 domain.ScopeEstimate — no task-classification or session-token-history lookup port exists yet in internal/app/ports.go (same Bootstrap gap already documented for predictor-05's FeatureSource). RuleTokenForecaster depends on its own package-local internal/predictor/token.FeatureSource interface (Classification, Session, Progress, RecentSimilarTurnTokens) rather than editing internal/app/ports.go (not this role's path) or guessing a DTO shape into it. A later wave's storage-backed implementation can satisfy this interface; a fake satisfies it in tests."
  - "Cold-start-only scope: no durable historical telemetry store exists yet this wave (the same gap already established for predictor-05/predictor-06's cold-start-only implementations — ADR-041's own cold-start note for predictor-05c applies by the same reasoning to predictor-05b, since both depend on claude-provider-05/foundation-06 landing in a later wave). The >=8-similar-samples empirical branch (ADD §15.2's exact gate) is implemented and exercised by tests, so a future FeatureSource backed by real storage activates it for free, but every result this wave is Calibrated=false with Confidence never exceeding ConfidenceMedium (reached only via the empirical-base branch; ConfidenceLow otherwise) — never a fabricated calibrated claim."
  - "P80 assumption (explicitly flagged by this node's scope): ADD §15.2's base-quantile description names only base_p50/base_p90 ('weighted_quantile(tokens, 0.50)' / '0.90'), no base_p80. Rather than inventing an unrelated third empirical quantile, TokensP80 is interpolated between the (multiplier-adjusted) P50 and P90 in log-space at a 60%-of-the-way-to-P90 weight (internal/predictor/token/forecaster.go's interpolateP80), matching the right-skewed shape of Preflight_Predictor_Design_Supplement.md's own P50/P80/P95 worked example (38000/61000/94000). This is a documented assumption, not a spec-derived value."
  - "ADD §14.6's cold-start table gives a *relative token multiplier* per task class, not an absolute token count. internal/predictor/token/coldstart.go anchors that relative scale to a bootstrap absolute baseTurnTokens=6000 constant (documented as a bootstrap starting point, explicitly not a measured universal benchmark, mirroring the ADD's own disclaimer for the sibling files/lines table). The 8 task classes ADD §14.6 does not name use a documented nearest-neighbor fallback table, independent from (not imported from) scope/coldstart.go's own fallback table, since the two tables measure different quantities and must not silently couple."
  - "verification_multiplier's build_required term has no direct ScopeEstimate/PromptFeatures signal wired up this wave; it is treated as implied by RequiresIntegration (an integration-test-requiring turn is assumed to also require a build) rather than left uncounted — documented assumption."
  - "complexity_multiplier's repository_wide term has no direct ScopeEstimate boolean; approximated by FilesChangedP90 >= 15, mirroring scope.RuleScopeEstimator's own ReasonLargeFileScope threshold, rather than left uncounted."
  - "retry_multiplier and progress_multiplier read SessionFeatures.RetryRate and ProgressFeatures.CompletedRatio respectively (nil or !ok both mean 'unknown' -> neutral multiplier 1.0 with a cold-start reason code, never a fabricated zero). progress_multiplier's 'remaining_critical_path_cost / original_task_cost' ratio (ADD §15.2) is approximated as 1 - CompletedRatio, since no separate cost model exists yet — documented assumption, ADD §15.2 does not specify how critical-path cost is measured."
  - "ambiguity_multiplier's mapping from the ADD's four named bands (1.0/1.2/1.5/2.0) to PromptFeatures signals (explicit paths + acceptance criteria named -> 1.0; explicit paths only -> 1.2; no explicit paths, not open-ended -> 1.5; OpenEndedIndicator -> 2.0) is this package's own documented interpretation, since the ADD names the bands and multipliers but not the exact feature-to-band rule."
  - "Per-multiplier cap (3.0) and combined geometric-mean cap (6.0) are this package's own conservative defaults implementing ADD §15.2's explicit 'avoid multiplier explosion, do caps' instruction — no exact cap values are specified in the ADD. Verified by TestTokenForecastMultiplierCapsPreventExplosion with intentionally extreme/absurd inputs (10^9 lines changed, retry rate of 100, negative completed ratio) asserting the result stays within a cap-derived bound and remains non-negative/monotonic."
  - "No Missing_Telemetry_Report.md file was found anywhere in this repository (searched exhaustively); the cold-start-only scope for this node is instead corroborated directly by ADR-041's own text (predictor-05c's cold-start note, same reasoning applies to predictor-05b) and by the absence of any durable telemetry store in this branch's dependencies (claude-provider-05/foundation-06 not yet landed) — noted here as a discrepancy between the assigning instruction and repository contents, not acted on further since the conclusion (cold-start-only) is unaffected."

## Wave 3 summary

The single assigned node (`predictor-05b`) is `completed` with durable artifacts and passing validation
commands, on branch `day1/predictor`. `predictor-05c` (Quota Forecaster) and `predictor-07` (Risk
Combiner) were deliberately not started, per explicit instruction, despite `predictor-05c` nominally
depending on `predictor-05b` which is now done. No `RuleQuotaForecaster`, `RiskCombiner` implementation,
or anything beyond `RuleTokenForecaster` was written. No other role's paths were touched. No merge/rebase
onto `main` was performed or needed this wave.

## Wave 4 (predictor-01, predictor-05c)

Branch: `day1/predictor`, continuing from `22fde28` (Wave 3, `predictor-05b`). Per explicit instruction,
`main` was merged first (`git merge main -m "Sync main (Wave 3) before predictor-01/05c"`) — a clean
fast-forward from `22fde28` to `ca7062f`, bringing in foundation-06/08, `predictor-05b`'s own already-merged
copy, `runtime-b01`, `qa-01/08`, plus a large batch of previously-unmerged foundation infrastructure
(`internal/cli`, `internal/config`, `internal/lock`, `internal/paths`, `internal/gitx`, `internal/storage/sqlite`
db/migrate engine, `internal/telemetry/claude`, CI/governance docs). Whole-repo `go build ./...` and
`go test ./...` both passed cleanly immediately after the merge, before any new code was written.

next_action: predictor-05c (same wave, sequential)
assumptions:
  - "Table set per Preflight_ADD.md §12.2's canonical schema, scoped to predictor's migration range (0040-0049 per CONTRACT_FREEZE.md): feature_vectors, predictions, runway_forecasts, policy_decisions, authorizations. No literal `evaluations` table exists in the ADD's §12.2 schema (domain.EvaluationID/app.Evaluation are backed by the `predictions` table plus policy_decisions, not a separate table) — the task instruction's 'evaluations/predictions/authorizations' phrasing is read as referring to this whole persistence surface (agents/predictor.md deliverable #11 'Evaluation persistence' + #12 'authorization issuance/consumption'), not a literal fifth table name."
  - "internal/storage/sqlite/migrate_test.go is owned by foundation (not one of predictor's exclusive paths). Per Constitution §4.4 ('a role never edits a file it doesn't own; it works around the gap with a documented assumption'), predictor-01's own migration-range validation lives in a new file, migrate_predictor_test.go, in the same shared sqlite_test package — additive only, no existing file touched. This exactly mirrors foundation-06's own established pattern of putting per-range migration tests directly in that package (TestAllMigrations_LoadsCoreSchemaFiles / TestCoreMigrations_*), with test names containing 'Migration0040' so the DAG's literal validation command selects them."
  - "DISCOVERED INTEGRATION HAZARD (real, not hypothetical — flagging for contract-integrator/foundation): feature_vectors/predictions/runway_forecasts/authorizations conceptually FK into `turns` (claude-provider's 0010-0019 range) and authorizations also into `repository_checkpoints` (checkpoint Part B's 0030-0039 range), per the ADD's §12.2 schema. Neither table exists as a migration anywhere yet (checked day1/claude-provider and day1/checkpoint branches directly — no migration files present on either). SQLite's `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` (already set by db.go) does NOT merely skip-enforce a REFERENCES clause pointing at a nonexistent table until it's populated — it makes ANY cascading DELETE reachable through that table fail outright with 'no such table: main.turns', even for completely unrelated rows, because SQLite resolves every FK-referenced table in the schema's cascade graph at DML prepare time. This was caught empirically: adding these tables with real REFERENCES clauses broke 3 of foundation-06's own already-passing, already-merged tests (TestCoreMigrations_ForeignKeys_RepositoryToWorktree, TestCoreMigrations_ForeignKeys_TaskSessionSetNull, and indirectly the reopen tests) on a plain `DELETE FROM repositories` that has nothing to do with predictor's tables. Fix applied: turn_id (on feature_vectors/predictions/runway_forecasts/authorizations) and repository_checkpoint_id (on authorizations) are plain unconstrained TEXT columns with NO SQL-level FK — exactly the precedent 0004_tasks.sql already established for its own forward reference to progress_nodes ('SQLite has no deferred cross-table FK addition without recreating the table'). Documented in each migration file's own header. Real FKs are kept wherever the target table already exists on this branch: runway_forecasts.session_id -> provider_sessions (0003), runway_forecasts.task_id -> tasks (0004), and the two same-range FKs in policy_decisions -> predictions/runway_forecasts (0041/0042, this range)."
  - "Consequence for whole-repo `go test ./...`: after this fix, TestCoreMigrations_ForeignKeys_RepositoryToWorktree and TestCoreMigrations_ForeignKeys_TaskSessionSetNull (both in foundation's migrate_test.go) now PASS again. Two foundation tests still fail on this branch — TestAllMigrations_LoadsCoreSchemaFiles and TestCoreMigrations_FromEmptyDatabase/TestCoreMigrations_ReopenFromFile_AppliesOnce — but only because they hardcode `len(migrations) != 4` / `CurrentVersion != 4` as strict-equality assertions that assume foundation's 4 migrations are the *only* ones that will ever exist in the embedded directory. This is a pre-existing test-design limitation in a file predictor does not own and cannot fix without violating its path boundary; it will break the same way regardless of merge order the moment ANY other role's migration range lands (claude-provider, checkpoint, or predictor — whichever merges first). Flagged here for contract-integrator/foundation to relax those two assertions (e.g. `>=` instead of `==`) at the next integration point, not fixed unilaterally by this role."
  - "authorizations' UNIQUE(turn_id) constraint and predictor-10's future 'consumed_at IS NULL' service-layer check together implement CONTRACT_FREEZE.md's 'Authorization — one-time; consumption is exactly-once' contract; UNIQUE(turn_id) alone only guarantees exactly-once *issuance* per turn, not exactly-once *consumption* (that half is a service-layer transaction concern, deliberately out of scope for a migration-only node)."

assumptions:
  - "New sibling package internal/predictor/quota (alongside internal/predictor/scope, internal/predictor/token, internal/predictor/runway), matching Preflight_Predictor_Design_Supplement.md's own naming: 'RuleQuotaForecaster — Version 1 — deterministic delta model, §15.3'. Unlike scope/token, this stage needs no package-local FeatureSource abstraction: app.ForecastQuotaRequest already carries everything Stage 3 needs directly (Quota []domain.QuotaObservation, Context domain.ContextObservation, TokenForecast domain.TokenForecast) — no session/repository/progress feature-lookup gap to bridge, so RuleQuotaForecaster is stateless (mirrors internal/predictor/runway.Scorer's own stateless design more than scope/token's FeatureSource-backed one)."
  - "Cold-start-only scope, exactly as CONTRACT_FREEZE.md's ADR-041 section explicitly anticipates and licenses for this node: 'QuotaForecaster implementations MAY produce a deterministic current-observation-plus-default-delta estimate ... before durable historical telemetry exists. This is not a stub to be later thrown away.' No durable telemetry store exists on this branch (claude-provider-05's persistence layer is a sibling Wave 4 node on a different, not-yet-merged branch), so ADD §15.3 step 5's empirical-P50/P90-from-samples branch is unreachable by construction — every result is Calibrated=false, Confidence=ConfidenceLow, ReasonPredictionColdStart always present."
  - "ADD §15.3/§15.9 do not name exact default-delta values (unlike §14.6's token-multiplier table). coldstart.go documents this package's own conservative bootstrap constants: defaultQuotaDeltaP50/P90 = 2.0/6.0 percentage points per turn; defaultContextGrowthP50/P90Fraction = 0.03/0.10 (3%/10% of context window capacity) — explicitly flagged as bootstrap starting points, not measured values, expected to be replaced by StatisticalQuotaForecaster's empirical quantiles (Version 2) once durable per-window delta samples exist."
  - "TokenForecast fallback (per app.ForecastQuotaRequest's own doc comment: 'MAY use TokenForecast as a fallback input when the provider does not expose quota percentage directly; MUST NOT require it'): tokenAdjustedDelta scales the default P90 delta/growth by TokensP90 relative to a nominal 6000-token 'typical turn' baseline (nominalTurnTokens, deliberately matching internal/predictor/token.baseTurnTokens's value but declared independently rather than imported across packages, mirroring internal/predictor/token/coldstart.go's own established rationale for keeping cold-start tables independent between packages that measure different quantities). Bounded to [0.5x, 3.0x] (tokenScaledDeltaFloor/Ceiling) so one extreme TokenForecast cannot blow up or erase the conservative default — same capping discipline as internal/predictor/token's per-multiplier caps, reused here since §15.3 gives no equivalent explicit cap. A zero-value TokenForecast (TokensP90<=0, i.e. no forecast supplied) leaves the default delta unscaled, verified by TestQuotaForecastZeroTokenForecastUsesUnscaledDefault."
  - "Multi-window combination (ForecastQuotaRequest.Quota is a slice, domain.QuotaForecast.ProjectedQuotaUsedP90 is a single scalar): reuses the same conservative max-across-windows rule already established by internal/predictor/runway.CombineWindows for the identical ADD §15.5 'v1 預設取 max，避免錯誤獨立假設' reasoning, rather than an independence-assuming combination formula — the worst (highest-projected) window drives the single returned value."
  - "Reset-awareness (ADD §15.8: 'resets_at 是 schedule hint'): projectOneQuotaWindow suppresses the delta (projection stays at current usage, not compounded forward) when ResetsAt falls within a fixed turnHorizon look-ahead (10 minutes, matching internal/predictor/runway.DefaultHorizon — no turn-duration forecast is wired up this wave to know precisely how long the upcoming turn will take, so a fixed conservative horizon is used as a documented assumption, same pattern runway already established for its own default horizon)."
  - "near-limit threshold (ReasonQuotaNearLimit/ReasonContextNearLimit): no exact percentage is named in ADD §15.3/§15.9 (unlike §15.7's explicit runway thresholds). 90% is used, chosen to mirror the P90 framing already used throughout this pipeline stage — a documented, conservative default, not a spec-derived value. QuotaObservation.Reached=true always triggers ReasonQuotaNearLimit regardless of UsedPercent, since Reached is the provider's own authoritative signal and must not be overridden by a percentage heuristic."
  - "ContextObservation fallback: when UsedPercent is nil but UsedTokens/WindowTokens are both present and WindowTokens>0, current usage is derived as UsedTokens/WindowTokens*100 (an equally valid measurement per usage.go's own field set) rather than treated as unknown; WindowTokens<=0 is explicitly guarded (TestContextForecastZeroWindowTokensIsUnknown) to avoid division by zero, falling back to unknown (nil), never a fabricated value."

## Wave 4 summary

Both assigned nodes (`predictor-01`, `predictor-05c`) are `completed` with durable artifacts and passing
validation commands, on branch `day1/predictor`. `main` was merged first per instruction (clean
fast-forward, `22fde28` -> `ca7062f`), confirmed building/testing cleanly before any new code was
written. `predictor-01` surfaced and fixed a real cross-role SQLite foreign-key hazard (documented above
in its own `assumptions` block) that would otherwise have silently broken foundation-06's already-merged
cascade-delete tests at the next integration point, regardless of merge order. `predictor-05c` is a new,
self-contained `internal/predictor/quota` package requiring no FeatureSource abstraction, unlike its
`scope`/`token` siblings. `predictor-07` (Risk Combiner) was explicitly out of scope this wave (blocked
on `predictor-05c` completing and being reviewed) and was not started, stubbed, or scaffolded. No other
role's paths were touched. `golangci-lint run ./...` reports 0 issues repository-wide as of this wave's
final commit.
