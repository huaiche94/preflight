# contract-integrator — Progress Artifact

Executed as the **Bootstrap stage** (lead-only, not a Wave 1 teammate task —
see `CONSTITUTION.md` pending amendment and repository owner's 2026-07-12
directive resolving the Wave 1 deadlock).

```yaml
node: bootstrap-01
status: completed
artifacts:
  - internal/domain/ids.go
  - internal/domain/measurement.go
  - internal/domain/status.go
  - internal/domain/status_test.go
  - internal/domain/failure.go
  - internal/domain/artifact.go
  - internal/domain/checkpoint.go
  - internal/domain/clock.go
  - internal/domain/errors.go
  - internal/domain/capability.go
  - internal/domain/usage.go
  - internal/app/ports.go
  - pkg/protocol/v1/event.go
  - pkg/protocol/v1/event_test.go
  - docs/implementation/day1/CONTRACT_FREEZE.md
  - go.mod
validation:
  - gofmt -l internal/domain internal/app pkg/protocol   # empty output
  - go build ./internal/domain/... ./internal/app/... ./pkg/protocol/...
  - go vet ./internal/domain/... ./internal/app/... ./pkg/protocol/...
  - go test ./internal/domain/... ./internal/app/... ./pkg/protocol/...
commit: 4262b4b
next_action: Commit Bootstrap, then spawn Wave 1 teammates (foundation, claude-provider, checkpoint, predictor) per repository owner's directive
assumptions:
  - CompleteNode's atomic transaction boundary is documented at the contract
    level (CONTRACT_FREEZE.md) but the actual state machine and transaction
    implementation belong to the checkpoint role, not this stage.
  - Request/response DTOs in internal/app/ports.go carry minimal fields
    sufficient to compile; owning roles may request additions through their
    own progress artifact rather than editing ports.go themselves.
  - Go toolchain upgraded 1.19.1 -> 1.26.5 via Homebrew (approved by
    repository owner) as an environment prerequisite, not a Bootstrap task.
