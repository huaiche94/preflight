| runtime-b01 | M | S/M — lighter than the M estimate suggested | 6 | 6 (doc.go, errors.go, errors_test.go, root.go, root_test.go, hook.go) | 350 LOC (DAG estimate) | one continuous pass, no wall-clock instrumentation in this environment | None — `internal/domain/errors.go`'s frozen `Error` shape and `internal/buildinfo.String()` were both already exactly sufficient; no new dependency or field was needed from a file this role doesn't own | None beyond the DAG's own 6-file estimate — `doc.go` carrying the naming-convention rationale (rather than a 7th standalone file) kept the count exactly at the estimate | None — the only real judgment call (kebab-case vs PascalCase hook subcommand casing, `ADR_Recommendations.md` REC-03) was pre-flagged by the task brief itself with an explicit answer to use, so it required documentation rather than open-ended research | An early draft of `root_test.go` added a defensive `var _ = cobra.Command{}` unused-import guard against a hypothetical future edit; caught immediately as unnecessary once the actual final import set was checked — cheap to avoid by writing the test table first and only importing what it needs, rather than importing defensively up front | Building every P0 command as a stub returning one shared `notImplemented(command string) error` helper, rather than N bespoke error constructions, made both the implementation and its test (`TestStubCommandsReturnNotImplemented`, table-driven over all 17 non-version leaf paths) nearly free — one assertion function, driven by the same path table used to assert tree registration. Recommend this "one typed-error constructor + one path table exercised by two different tests (tree-shape, stub-behavior)" pattern as the default whenever a future wave's node is a deliberate stub layer (e.g. if `checkpoint`/`predictor` ever need a similar honest-stub placeholder ahead of a dependency), rather than each stub command inventing its own ad hoc error value inline |

## Cross-node observations

- This was `runtime`'s first-ever node (no prior Wave 1/2 history to compare against, unlike
  `predictor`/`foundation`/`claude-provider`/`checkpoint`, all of which had earlier waves). The
  DAG's M/350-LOC/6-file estimate for `runtime-b01` proved accurate on file count and slightly
  generous on LOC (387 non-test / 561 total including tests) — consistent with the cross-role
  pattern already noted in `lessons_learned/predictor.md` that self-contained, dependency-light
  packages (no I/O, no concurrency, no cross-package wiring beyond already-frozen contracts) tend
  to land at or slightly under DAG estimates.
- The single most consequential non-code decision on this node was procedural, not technical:
  confirming *which* document was authoritative for hook-subcommand casing before writing any
  command `Use` strings, rather than picking one convention and discovering the conflict later via
  a failing review. Constitution §2's document priority order plus `ADR_Recommendations.md` REC-03
  together made this a five-minute lookup instead of a guess — worth noting as a positive case for
  keeping conflict history recorded in a findable place (`wave2-analysis/`) rather than only in
  chat/PR history that a fresh session (like this one, a first-ever assignment with no prior
  conversational context) cannot see.
- No blockers, unexpected dependencies, or scope surprises were severe enough to require raising a
  new ADR or deviating from the frozen contracts. `internal/domain/errors.go` and
  `internal/buildinfo` had everything needed without requesting an addition via this artifact.

# Lessons Learned — runtime (Wave 4: runtime-a01, runtime-b02)

| task_id | estimated_complexity | actual_complexity | estimated_files_changed | actual_files_changed | estimated_duration | actual_duration | unexpected_dependencies | unexpected_files | blockers_encountered | token_waste_observations | recommendations_for_preflight |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| runtime-a01 | S (DAG: 150 LOC, 3 files) | M — the SQL itself was S, but the forward-FK interaction with SQLite's cascade resolution turned a transcription task into a schema-design decision requiring an escalation write-up | 3 | 4 (3 .sql + 1 test file the DAG's validation command implies but the 3-file estimate didn't count) | 150 LOC | one continuous pass; the canonical-FK first draft was written, observed failing foundation's cascade tests, and rewritten — roughly doubling the node's effective LOC written vs. shipped | **Two undeclared ones.** (1) ADD §12.2's canonical `pause_records` FKs reference four tables from ranges 0010-0049 that don't exist yet; with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`, SQLite resolves every parent on any DML *including cascades from repositories/worktrees/tasks*, so shipping canonical FKs breaks foundation's existing tests and all task-delete DML repo-wide. Resolved via the 0004_tasks.sql plain-pointer precedent, escalated in the progress artifact. (2) foundation's migrate_test.go asserts exact migration count/version (==4), so *any* role landing migrations breaks 3 of foundation's tests — change request filed, not self-fixed | migrations_0050_pause_test.go lives in internal/storage/sqlite/ (foundation's dir) — unavoidable given the DAG's validation command; ownership carve-out requested | foundation's 3 stale assertions leave `go test ./internal/storage/sqlite/...` (unfiltered) red until their mechanical fix lands; runtime's own validation command passes | The canonical-FK first draft was honest exploration, not waste — but the failure mode (cascade DML poisoning) could have been predicted by reading 0004_tasks.sql's active_node_id comment *before* writing SQL, which names the identical problem class | When a DAG assigns a role a migration range that FKs into another role's not-yet-landed range, the DAG row should say explicitly whether to (a) declare forward FKs, (b) plain-pointer like 0004, or (c) block on the parent range — every migration-owning role after foundation will hit this exact fork, and the answer materially changes both schema and test shape. Also: range-owned migration tests need a declared home; "tests live where the validation command points" should be written into the execution plan's shared-file policy |
| runtime-b02 | M (DAG: 300 LOC, 4 files) | S/M — pure composition plumbing against already-frozen interfaces; zero I/O, zero concurrency | 4 | 9 (wiring.go, wiring_test.go, + 7 fakes files: doc, unconfigured helper, one per service interface) — more files but similar total LOC; per-interface fake files chosen so qa can later evolve one service's double without touching the rest | 300 LOC | one continuous pass, no rework | None — internal/app/ports.go's five service interfaces were exactly sufficient as-written; no DTO field additions needed, no go.mod change (cobra already present) | The DAG's 4-file estimate implicitly assumed fakes would be fewer files; splitting per-interface was a deliberate structure choice, not scope growth | None | None worth noting — reading ports.go once, fully, before writing any fake avoided every signature mismatch a per-method copy-as-you-go approach would risk | The Fake<Interface> + <Method>Func + loud-unconfigured-error pattern (extending runtime-b01's "one typed-error constructor" lesson) made 5 interface doubles nearly mechanical; recommend it as the repo-wide default when qa or any role needs a double for a frozen port. Also: wiring.New's fail-closed nil-field validation caught its own test-writing typos twice — construction-time composition validation pays for itself immediately, keep it when real services replace fakes |

## Wave 4 cross-node observations

- The wave's single most expensive lesson was runtime-a01's: **a canonical schema is not
  automatically a shippable migration** when migration ranges land out of numeric order across
  roles. SQLite's forward-FK tolerance at CREATE time combined with strict whole-parent-set
  resolution at DML time means one role's "correct per the ADD" migration can silently break every
  other role's DML through cascade chains. The 0004_tasks.sql precedent (plain pointer + comment +
  escalation) turned out to be the general answer, and is now applied twice in this repo — it
  should probably be written down once, authoritatively (execution plan §7 or an ADR), instead of
  each role rediscovering it against a red test suite.
- Cross-role test coupling surfaced for the first time this wave: foundation's exact-count
  assertions over the shared AllMigrations() set broke on contact with any second role's files.
  Range-scoped assertions (each role asserts only its own 00X0-00X9 slice) is the obvious
  convention; filed as a change request rather than fixed in place, per Constitution §4.4.
