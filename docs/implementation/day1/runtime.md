This is `runtime`'s first progress artifact. Per `agents/runtime.md`, this
role consolidates two internal sub-components — **Part A** (Graceful
Pause, Safe Points, Durable Scheduler) and **Part B** (Application
Orchestration, CLI, Local API). Wave 3's assigned node, `runtime-b01`, is
Part B only; Part A (`internal/pause/**`, `internal/scheduler/**`) is not
touched by this artifact and has no entry here yet.

## Handoff notes (Constitution §6.7 / agents/runtime.md "Handoff")

- **CLI package shape**: `internal/cli.NewRootCmd() *cobra.Command` is the
  single exported entry point, mirroring the constructor convention
  foundation-01 established directly in `cmd/preflight/main.go`
  (`newRootCmd()`/`newVersionCmd()`, unexported because that file is the
  binary's own package). Because `internal/cli` is a separate package
  intended for a future root-wiring step to import, `NewRootCmd` is
  exported; every other constructor in the package
  (`newVersionCmd`, `newHookCmd`, `newHookClaudeCmd`, `newInitCmd`,
  `newEvaluateCmd`, `newDecisionCmd`, `newCheckpointCmd`, `newProgressCmd`,
  `newStateCmd`, `newPauseCmd`, `newResumeCmd`, `newSchedulerCmd`,
  `newStatusCmd`, `newDoctorCmd`) stays unexported, matching the granularity
  of the ports/DTOs they will eventually call.
- **Stub error shape**: every command below `version` returns
  `notImplemented(command string) error` (`internal/cli/errors.go`), which
  builds the frozen `*domain.Error` (`internal/domain/errors.go`,
  `CONTRACT_FREEZE.md` "Error contract") with `Code: ErrCodeUnavailable`,
  `Retryable: true`, and `Details["command"]` set to the dotted command
  path (e.g. `"hook claude user-prompt-submit"`). `ErrCodeUnavailable` was
  chosen over `ErrCodeInternal` deliberately: the command surface itself is
  correct and will work once the corresponding service
  (`EvaluationService`, `ProgressTreeService`, `GracefulPauseService`, etc.
  — `internal/app/ports.go`) is wired by a later node (`runtime-b02`
  onward); this is an operational "not yet available," not a code defect.
  `version` is the sole exception — it has no service dependency
  (`internal/buildinfo.String()` only) and is fully real.
- **Command tree**: `NewRootCmd` registers all 18 P0 leaf commands named in
  `agents/runtime.md` Part B in one call, split across two files for
  readability — `internal/cli/root.go` (root + all commands except the
  `hook` subtree) and `internal/cli/hook.go` (`hook claude {statusline,
  user-prompt-submit, stop, stop-failure}`, kept separate because it is a
  three-level subtree, not a single command, and had enough of its own
  naming-convention context — see below — to warrant its own file and its
  own package doc paragraph).
- **`cmd/preflight/main.go` is untouched.** Per `agents/runtime.md`
  ("Do not edit `cmd/preflight/main.go`; the contract-integrator and
  foundation roles integrate root wiring. Add command constructors under
  owned paths.") and the Wave 3 task brief, this node only builds
  `internal/cli`'s constructors. `cmd/preflight/main.go` still wires only
  `version` (from foundation-01, Wave 1) and does not yet call
  `cli.NewRootCmd()` — that integration is explicitly out of scope for
  this role and belongs to `contract-integrator`/`foundation` in a later
  step. The DAG's validation command was run against the *existing*
  `cmd/preflight` binary (still `version`-only) to confirm `internal/cli`
  compiles cleanly into the module and does not break the existing build;
  `internal/cli`'s own `--help` behavior (the full P0 tree) is verified
  directly at the package level in `internal/cli/root_test.go`'s
  `TestHelpSucceeds`, since there is no owned binary target yet that wires
  the full tree.
- **Dependency requests**: none. Cobra (`github.com/spf13/cobra`) and
  `internal/buildinfo`/`internal/domain` were already available
  (foundation-01, Bootstrap); no new `go.mod` entry was needed.

## Naming-convention judgment call: kebab-case hook subcommands

`docs/implementation/day1/wave2-analysis/ADR_Recommendations.md` REC-03
documents a real, still-open discrepancy: `Preflight_ADD.md` Appendix E.3
spells Claude Code hook subcommands in PascalCase (e.g. `UserPromptSubmit`,
matching Claude's own hook-event-name casing), while `agents/runtime.md`'s
own P0 command list, this node's DAG validation command
(`docs/implementation/day1/EXECUTION_DAG.md` `runtime-b01`'s row), and the
Day-1 execution plan's demo script all independently use kebab-case
(`user-prompt-submit`). REC-03 explicitly names `runtime-b01`'s real CLI
command tree as the first place this decision becomes real, and recommends
resolving it via ADR before this node, not after — that ADR has not been
authored as of this commit.

This node follows **kebab-case** (`preflight hook claude
user-prompt-submit`, `stop-failure`), for two independent reasons:

1. Per Constitution §2's document priority order, `agents/runtime.md` (a
   role-scoped operational document, tier 4) is the most specific document
   that names this role's actual command surface, and it uses kebab-case
   verbatim. `Preflight_ADD.md` (tier 2) is architecturally senior in
   general, but Constitution §1's "one authoritative document per subject"
   table names no single sole source of truth for CLI subcommand string
   casing specifically, and three independently-authored frozen documents
   converging on kebab-case (vs. one on PascalCase) is itself evidence
   about which spelling the rest of the project actually built against
   (`integrations/claude/hooks.json`, per REC-03, already uses kebab-case
   too).
2. This node's own DAG validation command
   (`go build ./internal/cli/... && preflight --help`) does not
   independently test subcommand casing, but the task brief that assigned
   this node was explicit: use kebab-case, matching agents/runtime.md's own
   P0 list, and document the call rather than silently inventing a third
   answer.

**This is not a resolution of REC-03.** No ADR has been written; `runtime`
has no authority to accept one (Constitution §3.2 — only
`contract-integrator` accepts ADRs). If `Preflight_ADD.md` Appendix E.3 is
later confirmed as the intended casing via an accepted ADR, the fix is
mechanical: rename the four `Use` strings in
`internal/cli/hook.go`'s `newHookClaudeCmd` and update
`root_test.go`/`errors_test.go`'s path tables to match — no other file is
affected, since every stub command is otherwise identical regardless of
its `Use` string. Flagging this explicitly so a future wave doesn't have
to rediscover it: **REC-03 should still be raised as a real ADR** even
though this node made a documented, non-blocking judgment call to proceed
under kebab-case in the meantime.

  - "Every command below `version` is an honest stub returning

  - "internal/cli/root.go groups most P0 leaf commands (version, init,
    evaluate, decision, checkpoint, progress, state, pause, resume,
    scheduler, status, doctor) into a single file rather than one file per
    command. The DAG estimated 6 files/350 LOC for runtime-b01; one file
    per command (13 top-level constructors) would have produced far more
    files than that estimate for what is, this wave, structurally
    identical boilerplate per command (a Use/Short/RunE stub). `hook` was
    split out on its own because it is a three-level subtree with its own
    naming-convention discussion, which justified a dedicated file and
    package-doc paragraph the other commands don't need yet. This may be
    resplit into per-domain files (e.g. a checkpoint.go, a pause.go) once
    real business logic lands behind each command in runtime-b02 onward
    and the single-file grouping stops being the natural shape."
  - "NewRootCmd is exported (capital N) unlike foundation-01's
    unexported newRootCmd in cmd/preflight/main.go, because
    internal/cli is a separate package a future root-wiring step needs to
    import; cmd/preflight/main.go's own newRootCmd stays package-private
    since nothing outside that package needs it. Both conventions coexist
    correctly per Go visibility rules; this is not a contradiction of
    foundation's established pattern, just the same pattern applied at a
    package boundary that didn't exist yet when foundation-01 was written."

# Wave 4

Branch: `day1/runtime`, synced from `main` (Wave 3 integration state,
`664436d`) via fast-forward before any Wave 4 work — required so
foundation-06's migration engine + 0001-0004 core-schema files exist on
this branch. Assigned nodes, executed sequentially: `runtime-a01`
(Part A migrations 0050-0059), then `runtime-b02` (app wiring).

## runtime-a01 — Graceful Pause/Scheduler core migrations

### What shipped

- `internal/storage/sqlite/migrations/0050_pause_records.sql` —
  `pause_records` + `idx_pause_status` (ADD §12.2/§12.3).
- `internal/storage/sqlite/migrations/0051_wake_jobs.sql` — `wake_jobs` +
  `idx_wake_jobs_due`, including `UNIQUE(pause_id, job_kind)` (the
  schema-level exactly-once-wake anchor) and the column set the ADD §12.4
  lease query requires (`status`, `run_after`, `lease_owner`,
  `lease_expires_at`, `attempts`, `max_attempts`).
- `internal/storage/sqlite/migrations/0052_resume_attempts.sql` —
  `resume_attempts` audit-trail table.
- `internal/storage/sqlite/migrations_0050_pause_test.go` — this range's
  tests (all named `TestMigration0050_*` so the DAG's validation command
  `go test ./internal/storage/sqlite/... -run Migration0050` selects
  exactly these): embedded-file loading, apply-from-empty (tables +
  §12.3 indexes present), idempotent re-apply, FK enforcement into
  foundation's `tasks`/`provider_sessions` (reject unknown ids; full
  repository → worktree → task → pause cascade), `runway_forecast_id`
  NOT NULL, wake-job cascade + unique-kind, resume-attempt
  survives-wake-job (SET NULL) but not pause (CASCADE).

### Documented deviation from ADD §12.2 canonical FKs (needs contract-integrator's eye; mirrors the 0004_tasks.sql precedent)

ADD §12.2 declares `pause_records.turn_id/runway_forecast_id/
state_checkpoint_id/repository_checkpoint_id` as `REFERENCES` into
`turns` (claude-provider 0010-0019), `runway_forecasts` (predictor
0040-0049), `state_checkpoints` (checkpoint 0020-0029), and
`repository_checkpoints` (checkpoint 0030-0039). None of those migration
files exist yet. SQLite accepts forward FK declarations at CREATE time,
but with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` it resolves *every* parent table on
*any* DML touching the child — **including cascade processing initiated
from `repositories`/`worktrees`/`tasks` deletes**. Empirically (first
draft of this node used the canonical FKs): foundation's own
`TestCoreMigrations_ForeignKeys_*` tests immediately failed with
`no such table: main.repository_checkpoints` on a plain
`DELETE FROM repositories`, i.e. the forward FKs would have poisoned
unrelated DML repo-wide and hard-blocked `runtime-a02` (pause state
machine, DAG-scheduled against runtime-a01 alone) on three other roles'
ranges.

Resolution: these four columns ship as plain `TEXT` pointers, exactly the
precedent foundation-06 set for `tasks.active_node_id` → `progress_nodes`
in `0004_tasks.sql`. FKs that *can* be enforced today (into `tasks`,
`provider_sessions`, and within this range `wake_jobs`/`resume_attempts` →
`pause_records`) are declared and tested. **Proposal to
contract-integrator:** once 0010-0049 have all landed, either (a) accept
the plain-pointer precedent permanently (consistent with 0004), or (b)
assign runtime a follow-up migration in its own range (0053+) that
recreates `pause_records` with the canonical FK set via SQLite's
copy-drop-rename pattern. Either way the decision belongs above this role;
this node did not silently pick (a) forever — it picked the only option
that keeps the repo's DML working today, and flagged the choice here.

### CHANGE REQUEST → foundation (Constitution §4.4 — not edited by runtime)

Three assertions in `internal/storage/sqlite/migrate_test.go`
(foundation's file) are over-constrained and fail the moment *any* later
role's migration range lands — which contradicts `migrate.go`'s own
design comment ("later roles' migrations … are picked up automatically
once present, with no change needed here"):

1. `TestAllMigrations_LoadsCoreSchemaFiles` asserts
   `len(migrations) == 4` — should filter to foundation's own 0000-0009
   range (the way `TestMigration0050_AllMigrationsIncludesPauseRange`
   filters to 0050-0059).
2. `TestCoreMigrations_FromEmptyDatabase` asserts `CurrentVersion == 4` —
   should assert `>= 4` or derive the expectation from `AllMigrations()`.
3. `TestCoreMigrations_ReopenFromFile_AppliesOnce` asserts
   `CurrentVersion == 4` — same fix.

Until foundation applies this mechanical fix, `go test
./internal/storage/sqlite/...` (full package, no `-run` filter) reports
these three failures on this branch. **No runtime-owned test fails**, and
the failures are assertion staleness, not behavior: foundation's
FK/cascade/unique behavioral tests all still pass against the combined
0001-0052 schema. Per Constitution §4.4 runtime did not edit the file and
did not wait idle; flagging here for foundation + the merge integrator.

```

## runtime-b02 — App wiring (in-process composition layer)

### What shipped

- `internal/app/wiring/wiring.go` — the composition container:
  `Services` (one field per frozen service interface: `Evaluation`,
  `ProgressTree`, `StateCheckpoint`, `GracefulPause`,
  `RepositoryCheckpoint` — `internal/app/ports.go`), `New(Services)
  (*App, error)` (fail-closed construction: any nil field returns the
  frozen `domain.Error` with `ErrCodeValidation`, `Retryable: false`, and
  `Details["missing_services"]` naming every hole — a composition bug
  surfaces at startup, not as a nil-pointer panic in whichever handler
  first hits it), one accessor per service, and `App.RootCmd()` — the
  wiring→CLI seam that returns `internal/cli.NewRootCmd()`'s tree today
  and is where runtime-b03+ threads real services into individual command
  handlers.
- `internal/testutil/fakes/` — first population of this directory
  (agents/runtime.md: "coordinate with the qa role"): `doc.go`
  (pattern contract), `unconfigured.go` (shared nil-Func behavior), and
  one file per frozen service interface (`evaluation.go`,
  `progresstree.go`, `statecheckpoint.go`, `gracefulpause.go`,
  `repositorycheckpoint.go`). Pattern: `Fake<Interface>` struct with one
  optional `<Method>Func` field per method; compile-time
  `var _ app.X = (*FakeX)(nil)` assertions; calling an unconfigured
  method fails loud with `domain.Error{Code: ErrCodeUnavailable,
  Retryable: false, Details: {fake, method}}` rather than silently
  returning zero values. No call recording/counting machinery — tests
  needing it build it in their own closures (Constitution §7 rule 10:
  no abstractions this milestone doesn't need).
- `internal/app/wiring/wiring_test.go` — validates: construction with
  all-fakes succeeds; each single missing service fails closed with the
  right code/retryability/details; all-missing lists all five; accessors
  return the injected instances (identity); calls through the container
  reach the configured fake closure with arguments intact (pass-through
  plumbing, no re-interpretation); unconfigured fake methods fail loud
  through the container; `RootCmd()` yields the full 13-top-level-command
  P0 tree from runtime-b01.

### Handoff notes

- **For qa**: `internal/testutil/fakes` is intentionally minimal and
  additive-friendly. If integration tests need recording fakes, add
  behavior in test-local closures first; only promote shared machinery
  into this package if several suites independently need the same thing.
- **For contract-integrator/foundation (root wiring)**: the intended
  binary composition is `wiring.New(Services{...real impls...})` followed
  by `app.RootCmd()`. `cmd/preflight/main.go` remains untouched by this
  role per agents/runtime.md.
- **For runtime-b03+ (this role)**: replace `RootCmd`'s direct
  `cli.NewRootCmd()` call by passing `a.services`' interfaces into the
  cli constructors as they gain real handlers; callers that already go
  through `App.RootCmd()` see no change.

# Wave 5

Branch: `day1/runtime`, synced from `main` (Wave 4 integration state,
`5470e4d`) via fast-forward merge before any Wave 5 work — clean, no
conflicts (this role only owns its own paths). Brings in
`foundation`'s migrate_test.go range-scoped-assertion fix, `checkpoint`'s
Part A/B core migrations (0020-0039), `predictor`'s quota forecaster
(`internal/predictor/quota`), and `claude-provider`'s telemetry event
store (`internal/telemetry/claude/store.go`).

Assigned nodes, executed sequentially with independent validate+commit
after each: `runtime-a02` (pause state transition validator) ->
`runtime-a06` (durable scheduler lease) -> `runtime-b03` (Evaluate
pipeline) -> `runtime-b04` (hook command handlers) -> `runtime-b05`
(checkpoint create orchestration) -> `runtime-b08` (status/doctor
commands) — Part A before Part B per the task brief, since both of
Part A's nodes were marked High risk (state-machine and concurrency
correctness) and Part B's four nodes are comparatively lower-risk
plumbing built on top of runtime-b02's existing wiring container.

## runtime-a02 — Pause state transition validator

### What shipped

- `internal/pause/doc.go` — package doc reconciling three documents'
  state-name vocabularies onto the twelve frozen `domain.PauseStatus`
  wire strings: agents/runtime.md's "Required state path" prose,
  `Preflight_ADD.md` §20.5's mermaid diagram, and the frozen enum
  itself (`internal/domain/status.go`, verified by
  `CONTRACT_FREEZE.md`). Several of the prose documents' named steps
  (`observing`/`Active`, `safe_point_reached`, `persisting`, `wake_due`,
  `EmergencyInterrupt`, `MinimalCheckpoint`) fold onto one frozen state
  each — documented explicitly rather than silently picked.
- `internal/pause/statemachine.go` — the explicit valid-transition
  table (P0 deliverable 1): `Event` vocabulary, `transitionTable` (every
  edge keyed by `(from, event)`), `terminalStates`, `Validate`/`Apply`/
  `IsTerminal`/`IsKnownState`/`ValidEvents`, and a `*TransitionError`
  type distinguishing unknown-state / terminal-state / no-edge
  rejections.
- `internal/pause/statemachine_test.go` — 17 tests covering the full
  nominal path, ADD §17.6's emergency skip-ahead, ADD §20.15's
  checkpoint-failure fail-closed rule, and every Part A required test
  provable at the state-machine level alone: unsafe-quota-reschedules,
  repo-overlap-blocks, cancel-wins-race-with-wake, provider-interrupt-
  failure-recoverable, plus terminal-state/unknown-state/invalid-edge
  rejection and full table-completeness structural checks.

## runtime-a06 — Durable scheduler lease

### What shipped

- `internal/scheduler/doc.go` — package doc mapping ADD §12.4's lease-
  claim transaction concept and §12.7's lease/retry parameters onto
  this store's design.
- `internal/scheduler/lease.go` — `Store` with `Schedule`/`Get`/`Claim`/
  `Renew`/`Complete`/`Fail`/`ReclaimExpired` against the `wake_jobs`
  table (runtime-a01's migration 0051). `Claim` reserves a single
  physical `*sql.Conn` (not a pooled `*sql.Tx`) and issues `BEGIN
  IMMEDIATE`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` directly on it, matching ADD §12.4's
  literal locking intent. `Claim`'s predicate is deliberately widened
  beyond ADD §12.4's literal `status='scheduled'` text to also match a
  `leased` row whose lease has expired, so "expired lease reclaimed"
  holds directly against `Claim`, not only via the separate
  `ReclaimExpired` restart-recovery sweep (ADD §28.3 step 2, which
  still exists for startup diagnostics).
- `internal/scheduler/lease_test.go` — 17 tests: schedule+claim,
  lease renewal/complete/fail-with-backoff/fail-exhausts-max-attempts
  (each including a wrong-owner-conflict case), expired lease reclaimed
  (via bare `Claim` and via explicit `ReclaimExpired`), validation, and
  the two concurrency proofs required by the DAG's stated risk:
  `TestLease_ConcurrentWorkersYieldOneClaim` (many goroutines racing one
  job, exactly one wins) and
  `TestLease_ConcurrentWorkersAcrossManyJobsEachClaimedOnce` (N jobs, M
  workers, every job claimed exactly once) — both run under `-race`.

### Two real bugs caught and fixed by this node's own tests, before commit

1. **Self-deadlock**: `Claim`'s original implementation re-fetched the
   newly-claimed job through the pooled `*sql.DB` (`s.Get`) while still
   holding its own reserved `*sql.Conn` open for the transaction. Under
   full pool saturation (many concurrent `Claim` callers,
   `internal/storage/sqlite.DB` caps the pool at 8 connections), the
   re-fetch's connection request could never be satisfied — every
   goroutine ended up blocked in `database/sql`'s connection-wait queue
   simultaneously. `TestLease_ConcurrentWorkersAcrossManyJobsEachClaimedOnce`
   hung indefinitely on first run (had to be killed via `kill -9` after
   ~4 minutes real time / <1s CPU time, the signature of a wait-queue
   deadlock, not a spin). Fixed by adding a `getJob(ctx, Querier, id)`
   helper `Claim` calls against its OWN reserved connection, before
   `COMMIT`, instead of going back to the pool.
2. **Expired-lease blind spot**: `Claim`'s original SELECT only matched
   `status = 'scheduled'`, so a `leased`-but-expired row (exactly the
   "duplicate workers / expired lease" scenario) was invisible to
   `Claim` until a separate `ReclaimExpired` call reset it first —
   `TestLease_ExpiredLeaseReclaimedByAnotherWorker` failed on first run
   (`second Claim: Found = false, want true`). Fixed by widening the
   SELECT/UPDATE predicate to also match a leased row whose
   `lease_expires_at` has passed (see "What shipped" above).

Both bugs were caught by this node's own required tests before any
commit was made — not discovered later by a sibling role or at
integration time.

## runtime-b03 — Evaluate pipeline

### What shipped

- `internal/orchestrator/doc.go` — package doc scoping this node to
  agents/runtime.md Part B pipeline steps 1-6, and explaining why no new
  repository/worktree/session resolver port was invented (no frozen
  port exists yet for that; `EvaluateRequest` takes already-resolved
  IDs, the realistic shape for a hook handler or CLI command that
  already has them).
- `internal/orchestrator/evaluate.go` — `Evaluate(ctx, Deps,
  EvaluateRequest) (EvaluateResult, error)`: loads the Progress Tree
  (when a `TaskID` is given), loads usage observations via a narrow
  local `UsageObservationLoader` interface, snapshots Git state via
  `internal/gitx` (checkpoint role's public Git plumbing, consumed not
  owned), calls `app.EvaluationService.EvaluateTurn` then `.Decide`.
  Fail-open on the three operational-observation steps (Progress Tree/
  observations/Git snapshot — degrades `EvaluateResult`'s `Has*` flags
  without aborting); fail-closed on `EvaluateTurn`/`Decide` themselves
  (the pipeline's actual purpose, errors propagate as-is).
- `internal/orchestrator/evaluate_test.go` — 16 tests covering the
  happy path (both service calls made, in order), validation, nil-
  service fail-closed, both fail-closed propagation cases, and all
  three fail-open degradation cases (each with its own "error still
  degrades, doesn't abort" test plus a "value loads when present" test).

## runtime-b04 — Hook command handlers

### What shipped

- `internal/orchestrator/hooks.go` — `HandleStatusLine`/
  `HandleUserPromptSubmit`/`HandleStop`/`HandleStopFailure`: each
  parses via claude-provider-04's real, already-integrated parsers
  (`internal/providers/claude`, `internal/hooks/claude`), normalizes via
  claude-provider-04's real `Normalizer` (`internal/telemetry/claude`),
  best-effort persists via an injectable, nil-safe `EventPersister`, and
  (`HandleUserPromptSubmit` only) runs the evaluate pipeline
  (runtime-b03's collaborators) to render ADD §22.3's block/allow
  response shape. Every handler is fail-open on malformed stdin.
- `internal/orchestrator/hooks_test.go` — 16 tests against the real
  fixture files under `testdata/provider-events/claude/**`, including
  `TestHookHandlers_UserPromptSubmit_NeverSeesRawPromptText`, which
  asserts the hash `EvaluateTurn` receives is a 64-char hex digest, not
  the fixture's raw prompt text.
- `internal/cli/hook.go` — added exported `NewHookClaudeCmd(HookDeps)`,
  the real command tree, alongside the existing package-private stub
  tree (renamed `newHookClaudeCmd` -> `newHookClaudeStubCmd`, still used
  by standalone `NewRootCmd()`).
- `internal/app/wiring/wiring.go` — `RootCmd()` now replaces the stub
  `hook` subtree with `NewHookClaudeCmd`'s real one, built from a new
  optional `Services.Hooks` field (`HookSupport`: `Clock`/`IDs`/
  `Persister`/`TxRunner`) that falls back to real `domain.Clock`/
  `domain.IDGenerator` when left unset.

## runtime-b05 — Checkpoint create orchestration

### What shipped

- `internal/orchestrator/checkpoint.go` — `CheckpointCreate(ctx, Deps,
  Request) (Result, error)`: calls `app.StateCheckpointService.Create`
  THEN `app.RepositoryCheckpointService.Create`, in that order, never
  the reverse. Fails closed on either nil dependency (checked up front,
  before any call) and propagates either service's error as-is; a State
  failure means Repository is never even attempted.
- `internal/orchestrator/checkpoint_test.go` — 6 tests, the two most
  important being `TestCheckpointCreate_CallsStateBeforeRepository`
  (records actual call order through both fakes) and
  `TestCheckpointCreate_StateFailureNeverCallsRepository` (proves
  Repository is never reached at all when State fails — not called-
  then-ignored, never reached).
- `internal/cli/checkpoint.go` — `NewCheckpointCmd(CheckpointCreateDeps)`,
  reading `--task-id`/`--worktree-id` flags (no resolver port exists,
  same documented scope boundary as runtime-b03).
- `internal/app/wiring/wiring.go` — added a `replaceSubcommand` helper
  (refactored out of runtime-b04's inline hook-subtree-replacement loop
  so both nodes share one mechanism) and wired `checkpoint` through it.

## runtime-b08 — Status/Doctor commands

### What shipped

- `internal/orchestrator/diagnostics.go` — `Status(ctx, StatusDeps,
  StatusRequest) (StatusResult, error)`: best-effort session/Progress-
  Tree summary, fail-open on a missing/failing ProgressTree dependency.
  No pause-status field: the frozen `GracefulPauseService` port has no
  passive read query (only state-transition actions), so a read command
  must not call one just to render a summary. `Doctor(ctx, DoctorDeps)
  DoctorResult`: DB reachable (`Conn().PingContext`) + migrated
  (`CurrentVersion > 0`), config loadable (narrow `ConfigLoader`
  interface), required directories present+writable (probed via a
  create-then-remove temp file, verified to leave no residue). Every
  check is independently optional (`CheckSkipped` when unwired); overall
  `Healthy` is false only if some check actually `CheckFail`s.
- `internal/orchestrator/diagnostics_test.go` — 12 tests, including
  `TestDoctor_DoesNotMutateFilesystem` (directory entry count unchanged
  before/after a Doctor run) and a real, migrated `*sqlite.DB` test
  proving the DB check's OK path against the actual embedded migration
  set, not just a fake.
- `internal/cli/diagnostics.go` — `NewStatusCmd`/`NewDoctorCmd`, both
  always exiting 0 with a stable schema-versioned JSON body regardless
  of whether individual checks failed (a failing doctor check is
  content in the report, not a command-execution error).
- `internal/app/wiring/wiring.go` — added `Services.Diagnostics`
  (`DiagnosticsSupport`: `DB`/`Config`/`RequiredDirs`, all optional) and
  wired both commands through `replaceSubcommand`. `*sqlite.DB`
  satisfies `orchestrator.DBPinger` structurally with no new dependency
  from `orchestrator` onto the `sqlite` package (verified via a
  throwaway compile-time assertion during development, not committed).

## Post-node whole-repo lint sweep

After all six nodes, `golangci-lint run ./...` found 11 issues, all in
this wave's own new files (errcheck x1, errorlint x5, nilerr x3,
staticcheck x1, unused x1). Fixed all 11 in a dedicated commit
(`90078c3`) separate from the six node commits, per the same
never-batch-unrelated-work discipline — this commit is cleanup of
already-committed work, not a seventh node. `golangci-lint run ./...`
now reports 0 issues, whole repo; `go test ./... -race` is fully green
across every package, including `internal/storage/sqlite` (confirming
Wave 4's foundation migrate_test.go change request was resolved before
this wave began, as the task brief stated).

## Fakes used this wave (tracked for integration)

Every one of these was explicitly authorized by the task brief as a
soft/fake-able dependency for this wave; each is called out here so a
later integration pass can find every place that still needs a real
implementation swapped in.

| Node | Fake used in place of | Where |
|---|---|---|
| runtime-b03 | `predictor-08`/`predictor-09` (Policy/Evaluation persistence) — `app.EvaluationService` | `internal/orchestrator/evaluate.go`'s `Deps.Evaluation`, wired to `fakes.FakeEvaluationService` in tests and (until predictor lands) in `wiring` |
| runtime-b04 | Same `app.EvaluationService` fake (UserPromptSubmit's block/allow decision) | `internal/orchestrator/hooks.go`'s `HookDeps.Evaluation` |
| runtime-b05 | `checkpoint-a04` (real `CompleteNode`/state-checkpoint atomic protocol) — `app.StateCheckpointService` | `internal/orchestrator/checkpoint.go`'s `Deps.StateCheckpoint` |
| runtime-b05 | `checkpoint-b04` (repository checkpoint; being built this same wave by a sibling teammate, not yet merged) — `app.RepositoryCheckpointService` | `internal/orchestrator/checkpoint.go`'s `Deps.RepositoryCheckpoint` |

Explicitly NOT fake this wave, per the task brief and verified directly
in this artifact's node logs:

- `claude-provider-04`'s hook payload parsers and Normalizer (`internal/
  providers/claude`, `internal/hooks/claude`, `internal/telemetry/
  claude`) — real, already integrated (Wave 2), called directly by
  `runtime-b04`'s hook handlers.
- `internal/gitx` (checkpoint role's Git plumbing, consumed by
  `runtime-b03`'s Evaluate pipeline) — real, already integrated.
- `runtime-a02`/`runtime-a06` (Part A) have no sibling-role
  dependencies at all — both are pure, self-contained state-machine/
  storage-layer nodes with nothing to fake.
- `runtime-b08`'s `DBPinger`/`ConfigLoader` — narrow interfaces this
  node owns outright; nothing to fake.

# Wave 6

Branch: `day1/runtime`, synced from `main` via `git fetch origin && git
merge origin/main` (fast-forward, clean — no conflicts, this role only
owns its own paths) before any Wave 6 work. Brings in Wave 5's integrated
state, including `checkpoint`'s real `checkpoint-b04` (repository
checkpoint) landing on `main` and `predictor`'s risk combiner
(`internal/predictor/risk`). Per the task brief, `runtime-b05`'s existing
internal fake for `checkpoint-b04` was deliberately left as-is this wave
(not this wave's assignment to swap) — noted here, not silently changed.

Assigned nodes, all Part A, executed sequentially with independent
validate+commit after each: `runtime-a03` (Observe debounce/hysteresis) ->
`runtime-a04` (RequestPause idempotency + safe-point coordinator) ->
`runtime-a07` (restart recovery of overdue/leased jobs). `runtime-a03`/
`runtime-a04` both build directly on `runtime-a02`'s state machine;
`runtime-a07` builds on `runtime-a06`'s scheduler lease store. No Part B
work this wave.

## runtime-a03 — Observe debounce/hysteresis

### What shipped

- `internal/pause/observe.go` — `Observer` (per-`domain.SessionID`
  debounce/hysteresis state) and `Observe(sessionID, forecast,
  observedAt) ObserveDecision`, implementing ADD §17.6/§20.2's exact
  parameters as an `ObserveConfig` (threshold 0.80, min interval 5s,
  quota freshness 30s, reset band 0.70) plus the independent ADD §17.6
  emergency trigger (used>=98% or P50 time-to-limit<=60s), each with its
  own `TriggerReason` (`TriggerReasonCalibrated` /
  `TriggerReasonEmergency`) so the two paths are distinguishable per the
  "day-one realism" requirement. Emergency is checked first,
  unconditionally, and does not consume/clear an in-progress calibrated
  arm. Hysteresis reset requires RiskScore to actually fall below 0.70 —
  an in-between non-qualifying sample does not clear the arm, so two
  qualifying samples separated by noise still correctly trigger.
- `internal/pause/observe_test.go` — 13 tests: the two required tests
  verbatim (two qualifying observations trigger; one spike does not)
  plus too-soon-stays-armed, hysteresis-band, stale-quota-sample,
  missing-`QuotaObservedAt`-fails-closed, uncalibrated-never-qualifies-
  calibrated-path, both emergency branches, emergency-does-not-consume-
  arm, per-session isolation, and `Reset`.

    sample post-restart, which is a safe, conservative default, not a
    correctness gap)."

## runtime-a04 — RequestPause idempotency + safe-point coordinator

### What shipped

- `internal/pause/requestpause.go` — `PauseKey` (the natural
  `(TaskID, SessionID)` idempotency key — `pause_records` has no
  separate caller-supplied idempotency-key column, so the natural key
  serves the same role CONTRACT_FREEZE.md describes for
  `CompleteNodeRequest.IdempotencyKey`), a narrow internal `PauseStore`
  port (`FindActiveByKey`/`Insert`) deliberately declared in this
  package rather than `internal/app/ports.go` (an internal seam behind
  the already-frozen `GracefulPauseService` boundary, not a new
  cross-component contract), `RequestPause(ctx, store, ids, req)
  (RequestPauseResult, error)`, and `MemStore` (an in-memory reference/
  test `PauseStore` — the DAG's own note says no concrete store is
  required to begin this node; `runtime-a05` is expected to add a
  SQLite-backed `PauseStore` against the same interface).
- `internal/pause/safepoint.go` — `Boundary` vocabulary mapping ADD
  §20.4's exact safe/unsafe boundary lists, `SafePointCoordinator`
  interface plus `TurnBoundaryCoordinator` (the concrete turn/section-
  boundary implementation), and `PersistThenInterrupt` sequencing
  persist-then-interrupt against narrow `CheckpointPersister`/
  `Interrupter` seams — mirrors `runtime-b05`'s
  `internal/orchestrator.CheckpointCreate` ordering pattern (state
  before repository, early-return on the first error) one layer up, at
  the safe-point boundary instead of the checkpoint-role boundary. Only
  fakes are used for the checkpoint side this wave, per the DAG's
  explicit note and consistent with `runtime-b05`'s precedent.
- `internal/pause/requestpause_test.go` — 7 tests: first-call-creates,
  idempotent-replay-no-duplicate (many repeated calls converge on one
  record), replay-with-differing-reason-still-idempotent (emergency
  arriving mid-calibrated-pause does not fork a second record),
  fresh-cycle-allowed-once-prior-pause-terminal, per-key isolation,
  request validation, and store-error propagation.
- `internal/pause/safepoint_test.go` — 6 tests: the required test
  verbatim ("safe point persists checkpoints before interrupt",
  proven via call-order-recording fakes — not just "both were called"),
  persist-failure-never-reaches-interrupt, unsafe-boundary-rejected-
  before-either-collaborator-runs (every ADD §20.4 unsafe boundary plus
  an unrecognized one), every ADD safe boundary accepted, and
  input/nil-collaborator validation.

    faster), not a caller error; any actual escalation policy (e.g.
    shortening the quiesce timeout) is left to a later node."

## runtime-a07 — Restart recovery of overdue/leased jobs

### What shipped

- `internal/scheduler/restart.go` — `Store.Restart(ctx)
  (RestartReport, error)`, intended to be called once at process
  startup before any worker calls `Claim`. Unlike `ReclaimExpired`
  (runtime-a06, which only releases a lease once `lease_expires_at` has
  actually passed — the correct behavior at any other time), `Restart`
  releases every `leased` row unconditionally: by definition every
  lease owner recorded in the DB before this call belongs to a
  now-dead previous process instance, so waiting out a stale lease's
  remaining TTL would only delay recovery for no benefit (ADD §28.3
  steps 2/8, §20.7's "on next daemon start process overdue jobs", crash
  matrix "wake job leased then daemon dies -> lease expiry reclaims",
  §29.6 scenario 11 "daemon restart rebuilds job"). `done`/`dead` rows
  are untouched (no resurrection of already-finished or
  already-exhausted work); `Restart` never claims or executes anything
  itself, relying on `Claim`'s existing `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` serialization
  to prevent duplicate execution once a row is claimable again.
  `RestartReport` (`RecoveredLeased`, `OverdueClaimable`) is returned
  for a future startup-report step (ADD §28.3 step 10) to consume.
- `internal/scheduler/restart_test.go` — 6 tests: the required test
  verbatim ("restart recovers wake job" — a leased-but-never-completed
  job whose lease has NOT yet expired, recovered and re-claimable by a
  fresh `Store` instance against the same underlying DB, with no
  duplicate execution proven via the Attempts count and a rejected
  stale `Complete` call), plus already-expired-lease coverage (proving
  `Restart` is a superset of `ReclaimExpired`, not a narrower
  replacement), done/dead-jobs-untouched, multi-job sweep, the
  `OverdueClaimable` count, and no-op-when-quiescent.

## Wave 6 cross-node observations

- All three nodes landed at or under their DAG estimates (each M/300
  points/~3-4h) with no rework and no blockers — the lowest-friction
  wave this role has had, consistent with all three nodes building
  directly on top of already-frozen, already-tested prior work
  (`runtime-a02`'s state machine, `runtime-a06`'s lease store) rather
  than integrating a new cross-role dependency.
- `runtime-a03` and `runtime-a04` both needed a small, explicitly-scoped
  package-local vocabulary (`TriggerReason`, `Boundary`) rather than
  reusing or extending a frozen enum — each was checked against
  CONTRACT_FREEZE.md and Constitution §6 rule 4 first to confirm it was
  this package's own bookkeeping, not a state value, before adding it.
- `runtime-a07`'s only real design decision — reclaiming every leased
  row unconditionally at restart, rather than reusing `ReclaimExpired`'s
  expiry-gated predicate — followed directly from reasoning about what
  "restart" categorically implies (every previous lease owner is dead)
  rather than from any new external dependency; documented explicitly in
  the node's own doc comment so a future reader does not mistake it for
  a redundant duplicate of `ReclaimExpired`.
- No new ADRs were required and no frozen contract needed a
  change-request escalation this wave. `checkpoint-b04` landing for real
  on `main` this wave did not require any change on this branch, per
  the task brief's explicit instruction to leave `runtime-b05`'s
  existing fake as-is until a future wave's integration step.
- Confirmed explicitly: this wave touched only `internal/pause/**` and
  `internal/scheduler/**` (Part A's exclusive paths) — no file under
  `internal/progress/**` (a sibling teammate's concurrent Wave 6 work on
  the distinctly-different `checkpoint-a04` node) or any Part B runtime
  path (`internal/orchestrator/**`, `internal/cli/**`,
  `internal/httpapi/**`, `internal/daemon/**`, `internal/app/wiring/**`,
  `internal/testutil/fakes/**`) was read for editing purposes or
  modified.

# Wave 7

Branch: `day1/runtime`, synced from `main` via `git fetch origin && git
merge origin/main` (fast-forward, clean — no conflicts) before any Wave 7
work, landing at `1440f4c`. Brings in Wave 6's integrated state: `checkpoint`'s
real `CompleteNode`/State Checkpoint work (`internal/progress`,
`internal/statecheckpoint`, migrations 0023-0024) and `predictor`'s real
Policy layer (`internal/policy`). Per the task brief, `checkpoint-a05`
(State Checkpoint service) and the frozen `app.StateCheckpointService`'s
real implementation are **not** part of this merge — they are sibling
teammates' concurrent work this same wave — so this wave still uses
`internal/testutil/fakes.FakeStateCheckpointService` for that one specific
dependency, exactly as instructed.

Assigned nodes, executed sequentially with independent validate+commit
after each: `runtime-a05` (persist phase orchestration) -> `runtime-b07`
(pause/resume/scheduler CLI wiring).

## runtime-a05 — Persist phase orchestration

### What shipped

- `internal/pause/persistphase.go` — `Persist(ctx, PersistDeps,
  PersistRequest) (PersistResult, error)`: sequences the five durable
  writes CONTRACT_FREEZE.md's "Transaction boundaries" section names —
  Progress Tree snapshot, State Checkpoint, Repository Checkpoint, Pause
  Record, Wake Job — in fixed order, each step idempotent-by-skip against
  a new `PersistProgress` field recorded on `PauseRecord`. `HaltAfter`/
  `HaltError` mirror `internal/progress.CompleteNode`'s own crash-injection
  vocabulary and technique exactly, per the task brief's explicit
  instruction to follow that precedent. A new `PersistPauseStore` interface
  (`GetProgress`/`SaveProgress`) is this file's only new storage seam;
  `pause.MemStore` implements it directly, extended with per-`PauseID`
  lookup (`findByID`) since `PersistProgress` is keyed by `PauseID`, not
  the `PauseKey` `MemStore`'s map already used.
- `internal/scheduler/lease.go` — added `Store.GetByPauseKind`, a
  read-only lookup by `(pauseID, kind)` — needed to recover an
  already-scheduled wake job's identity after a retried `Schedule` call
  hits the existing `UNIQUE(pause_id, job_kind)` constraint (the crash
  window between `Schedule`'s own commit and `Persist`'s bookkeeping of the
  resulting `WakeJobID`). Added here rather than left as a gap for a later
  node, since Part A owns `internal/scheduler` directly.
- `internal/pause/persistphase_test.go` — the required test verbatim
  ("crash after every phase resumes/reconciles correctly"): one test per
  phase boundary (`runToHalt` mirrors `internal/progress`'s own helper),
  each proving the halted state exposes exactly that phase's durable
  evidence and a subsequent `Persist` call resumes and completes without
  re-creating any already-durable checkpoint, plus a full reconciliation
  sweep across all five boundaries and validation/nil-dependency/unknown-
  pause-record fail-closed cases. The Repository Checkpoint step's tests
  build a REAL `internal/repocheckpoint.Service` against a real migrated
  temp-file SQLite database and a real temporary Git repository (skipped
  if `git` is unavailable) — no fake anywhere in that path, per the task
  brief.

### Design note: two backing stores for one conceptual pause record

`wake_jobs.pause_id` carries a real foreign key into the `pause_records`
SQL table (`0051_wake_jobs.sql`), but `PersistPauseStore` in these tests is
`pause.MemStore` — an in-memory store, not backed by that table. Every
crash-injection test therefore seeds BOTH: the in-memory record (this
package's own durable-progress bookkeeping) AND a matching real
`pause_records` row (so phase 5's `Schedule` call satisfies the FK). This
is flagged explicitly as a tracked gap for a later integration node (a real
SQLite-backed `PauseStore` implementing `PersistPauseStore` against the
same `pause_records` table `wake_jobs` already references), not silently
worked around.

## runtime-b07 — Pause/Resume/SchedulerRunOnce CLI+orchestrator wiring

### What shipped

- `internal/pause/lifecycle.go` — `Cancel` (applies `EventCancel` via the
  existing transition table, persists the result) and `Resume` (drives
  `WakePending -> Validating -> {Resuming -> Resumed | Sleeping |
  BlockedConflict}` from a caller-supplied verdict — `Valid`/`QuotaUnsafe`/
  `Conflict`, exactly one required). Resume's doc comment states explicitly
  that real resume validation (quota/repository/session/authorization
  checks, ADD §20.8) is `runtime-a08`'s not-yet-built scope; this node
  implements only the state-machine half, per Constitution §7 rule 3
  ("capability gaps are surfaced explicitly, never silently assumed
  away").
- `internal/pause/requestpause.go` — `PauseStore` gained `GetByID`/
  `UpdateStatus` (both implemented on `MemStore`), needed because
  Cancel/Resume take a caller-supplied `PauseID` (e.g. a `--pause-id` CLI
  flag) rather than the `PauseKey` `RequestPause`'s existing methods key
  on.
- `internal/orchestrator/pauselifecycle.go` — `PauseRequestCmd`,
  `PauseCancelCmd`, `ResumeCmd`, `SchedulerRunOnceCmd`: thin orchestration
  over this same role's own real `pause.RequestPause`/`Cancel`/`Resume` and
  `scheduler.Store.Claim` — no fake anywhere in this file, per the DAG's
  "now a hard dependency... same branch, no fake needed" note.
  `SchedulerRunOnceCmd` claims (does not execute) one due job per sweep —
  "run a single scheduler sweep and exit" names a claim step, not a full
  wake-to-resume pipeline (`runtime-a09`'s scope).
- `internal/cli/pause.go` — `NewPauseCmd`/`NewResumeCmd`/`NewSchedulerCmd`,
  the real Cobra constructors (schema-versioned JSON output, typed errors,
  no raw prompt/log leakage), replacing `root.go`'s stub tree the same way
  `NewCheckpointCmd`/`NewStatusCmd` did in earlier waves — `root.go` itself
  is untouched, per that same precedent (the standalone stub tree stays as
  the bare-`NewRootCmd()` fallback).
- `internal/app/wiring/wiring.go` — new optional `Services.PauseLifecycle`
  field (`orchestrator.PauseLifecycleDeps`); `RootCmd` swaps in the real
  `pause`/`resume`/`scheduler` command trees only when a `Store`/
  `WakeJobs` is actually configured, otherwise leaving the original stub
  tree mounted (mirrors `Diagnostics`' existing optional-field, all-skipped
  fallback precedent).

## Wave 7 cross-node observations

- `runtime-a05` was the wave's (and, per the DAG's own risk ranking,
  the role's) highest-risk node — crash-injection testing across FIVE
  independent write boundaries, two of them real cross-role services
  (Repository Checkpoint) rather than in-process fakes, required a
  heavier test harness (real SQLite DB + real temporary Git repository)
  than any prior Part A node needed. The `HaltAfter`/`HaltError`
  precedent transplanted from `internal/progress.CompleteNode` (Wave 6's
  sibling `checkpoint-a04` work, now on `main`) applied cleanly with no
  redesign — direct evidence the technique generalizes beyond the single
  package it was first proven in.
- A real, if narrow, gap was found and closed rather than deferred:
  `scheduler.Store` had no way to recover an already-scheduled job's
  identity after a retried `Schedule` call hit its own `UNIQUE(pause_id,
  job_kind)` constraint. Since Part A owns `internal/scheduler` directly,
  `GetByPauseKind` was added in the same node rather than punted to a
  future a06/a09 follow-up — the DAG's "no fake needed, same branch"
  principle for `runtime-b07`'s dependencies applies by the same logic to
  a same-role internal gap discovered mid-node.
- `runtime-b07` mirrors `runtime-b05`'s (Wave 5) wiring shape almost
  exactly (orchestrator file + test, CLI file, wiring.go diff) but for
  FOUR command surfaces instead of one `checkpoint create` — consistent
  with the Wave 5 lessons_learned observation that Part-B-shaped nodes'
  file count runs higher than the DAG's estimate once CLI+wiring are
  counted; this node's actual file count (9, including two modified
  pre-existing files) is in line with that established pattern, not a new
  surprise.
- No new ADRs, no change-request escalations, and no frozen-contract
  questions this wave. The one explicitly-tracked gap (`PersistPauseStore`
  as an in-memory store distinct from the real `pause_records` SQL table
  `wake_jobs` already references) is flagged in `runtime-a05`'s own
  section above for a later integration node, not silently resolved or
  left undiscoverable.

# Wave 8

Branch: `day1/runtime`, synced from `main` via `git fetch origin && git
merge origin/main` (fast-forward, clean — no conflicts) before any Wave 8
work, landing at `2b7c29c`. Brings in Wave 7's integrated state: `checkpoint`'s
real `internal/statecheckpoint.Service` (`app.StateCheckpointService`) and
`internal/repocheckpoint`'s orphan-scan/crash-safety hardening, and
`predictor`'s real `internal/evaluation.Service`
(`app.EvaluationService`/`ConsumeAuthorization`, `predictor-09`). Per the
task brief, `predictor-10`'s authorization-hardening pass is a concurrent
sibling this same wave, not yet mergeable — this wave still uses
`internal/testutil/fakes.FakeEvaluationService` for the one
`ConsumeAuthorization` call this node makes, consistent with the
established fake-then-swap pattern.

Assigned node: `runtime-a08` (Resume validation).

## runtime-a08 — Resume validation

### What shipped

- `internal/pause/resumevalidation.go` — the real check
  `lifecycle.go`'s package comment named as its own explicit gap: four
  independently-swappable checkers, one per agents/runtime.md Part A
  deliverable 8 check, each returning a uniform `CheckResult{Pass, Reason,
  Detail}`:
  - `CheckQuotaSafety` (`QuotaSnapshotReader` seam): re-reads current quota
    for the same limit the pause-time baseline recorded and fails if it has
    gotten WORSE (higher `UsedPercent`, or a new transition into
    `Reached`) — never assumed safe on an unreadable comparison (nil
    `UsedPercent` on either side fails closed).
  - `CheckRepositoryCompatibility` (`app.RepositoryCheckpointService.Verify`
    — REAL, checkpoint-b04, integrated since Wave 5 — plus a package-local
    `RepoFingerprintReader` seam for the CURRENT repository state): first
    confirms the pause-time checkpoint itself still verifies intact, then
    compares its recorded `GitHead` against the current fingerprint. No
    change at all passes trivially; a change that overlaps the paused
    work's own files always blocks (`ReasonRepositoryOverlapBlocks`,
    regardless of policy); a non-overlapping ("unrelated") change is
    allowed or blocked per a caller-supplied `RepoChangePolicy`
    (`RepoChangePolicyAllowUnrelated` default, or `RepoChangePolicyBlockAny`).
  - `CheckSessionCapability` (`SessionCapabilityReader` seam): the provider
    session must currently report `Resumable`, plus an optional explicit
    `domain.ProviderCapabilities.SessionResume` requirement.
  - `CheckAuthorization` (`app.EvaluationService.ConsumeAuthorization` —
    FAKE this wave, see below): a rejected/expired/already-consumed
    authorization and a genuinely-unreachable authorization service are
    both failures, but with distinct reason codes
    (`ReasonAuthorizationInvalid` vs. `ReasonAuthorizationServiceUnavailable`)
    so a caller/audit trail can tell "we asked and it said no" apart from
    "we could not ask."

  `ValidateResume(ctx, ResumeValidationDeps, ResumeValidationRequest)
  (ResumeValidationResult, error)` orchestrates all four, in the fixed
  order quota → repository → session → authorization (cheapest/most-
  reschedulable first; authorization — the one-time, non-reversible
  resource — last). It does NOT stop at the first FAILING check (a caller
  building a full audit trail, or a human resolving `BlockedConflict` via
  ADD §20.9's UI, needs every check's own outcome); a downstream READ
  failure inside any one checker is reported as a failing `CheckResult`
  with an `_UNAVAILABLE` reason code, not a Go error, so it is exactly as
  visible in the result as any other rejection. A returned Go error is
  reserved strictly for a composition bug (nil dependency, missing
  `SessionID`) and aborts immediately, before running any check.
  `ResumeValidationResult.Verdict()` maps the four results onto
  `lifecycle.go`'s existing `ResumeRequest{Valid, QuotaUnsafe, Conflict}`
  three-way verdict: all-pass → `Valid`; quota failing ALONE (every other
  check passing) → `QuotaUnsafe` (reschedule, per the required test); any
  other failure (repository, session, or authorization, alone or combined
  with a quota failure) → `Conflict` (block) — a simultaneous quota +
  repository failure still blocks, it does not silently reschedule past an
  unresolved conflict.

  `RescheduleWakeJobOnQuotaUnsafe` proves "unsafe quota reschedules" at the
  scheduler-integration level, not just the pause-record state-machine
  level `lifecycle.go`'s existing `Resume` already covers: when
  `ValidateResume`'s verdict is `QuotaUnsafe`, it calls
  `scheduler.Store.Fail` on the associated wake job (via a narrow
  `WakeJobRescheduler` seam `*scheduler.Store` satisfies directly) — reusing
  `Fail`'s existing ADD §20.7 backoff-then-retry-or-dead machinery
  (runtime-a06) rather than inventing a second reschedule mechanism, since
  a quota-unsafe resume attempt IS a failed attempt from the wake job's own
  perspective. It is a no-op (does not call `Fail`) for a `Valid` or
  `Conflict` verdict. Driving this from the actual scheduler-claimed wake
  job in a full wake-to-resume pipeline (claim → validate → drive
  `EventWakeDue`/`Resume` → reschedule-or-block) remains `runtime-a09`'s
  scope, per the DAG (`runtime-a09` depends on `runtime-a08` and covers
  `DuplicateWake`/`Cancel`); this node proves the reschedule mechanism
  itself is correct and available.

- `internal/pause/resumevalidation_test.go` — 42 tests, all named
  `TestResumeValidation_*` (or `TestResumeValidationResult_*`) so the DAG's
  exact validation command (`-run ResumeValidation`) selects the whole
  file. Covers every one of agents/runtime.md's Part-A-deliverable-8
  required tests verbatim: "unsafe quota reschedules" (both at the
  `CheckQuotaSafety`/`Verdict()` level and, separately, proven directly
  against the scheduler via `RescheduleWakeJobOnQuotaUnsafe` actually
  calling `scheduler.Store.Fail`), "repo overlap blocks" (proven at both
  `CheckRepositoryCompatibility` and `ValidateResume` levels, and shown to
  hold regardless of policy), "unrelated repo change follows configured
  policy" (both policies, both levels) — plus every fail-closed case named
  in this node's own design brief: unknown/nil quota comparison, checkpoint-
  invalid, fingerprint-unreadable, session-not-resumable, capability-
  confirmed-absent, authorization-rejected vs. authorization-service-
  unavailable (distinct reason codes), nil-dependency validation for every
  one of the five `ResumeValidationDeps` fields, malformed-request
  validation, the "every check still runs after an earlier FAILURE (not an
  error)" ordering guarantee, and the "a downstream READ failure surfaces
  as a CheckResult, not a Go error, and does not block later checks"
  distinction this node's design deliberately draws.

### Design note: two failure channels, chosen deliberately

`ValidateResume`/each checker returns `(CheckResult, error)`, and the two
mean different things: a downstream service erroring when asked (quota
read fails, `Verify` errors, session/capability read fails,
`ConsumeAuthorization` errors) is captured as a FAILING `CheckResult` with
an `_UNAVAILABLE`-suffixed reason code — still fail-closed (the check does
not pass), but visible through the same channel a normal rejection uses, so
a future `resume_attempts` audit row (0052_resume_attempts.sql already has
exactly the right columns: `repository_fingerprint_before/after`,
`quota_used_percent`, `failure_code`) or a human resolving `BlockedConflict`
sees a labeled reason, not a generic error. A returned Go `error` is
reserved for a composition bug (nil dependency, malformed request) and
aborts before any check runs. An earlier draft conflated these two (treating
every checker error as an abort-everything signal); this node's own test
suite caught the inconsistency before commit (see Lessons Learned) and the
design was corrected to the two-channel split described here, which is also
what makes `RescheduleWakeJobOnQuotaUnsafe`'s failure-reason string
(`result.FirstFailure()`) meaningful — it always has something to report.

## Wave 8 cross-node observations

- This wave's one node closes the last explicitly-named gap in
  `lifecycle.go`'s `Resume` (its own package comment named runtime-a08 as
  the owner of "real resume validation," not yet built) — `Resume` itself
  was not modified; `ValidateResume`/`Verdict()` are additive, designed to
  feed `Resume`'s existing caller-supplied-verdict parameter without
  requiring any change to `lifecycle.go`'s frozen shape from prior waves.
- Consistent with this role's established practice, the one real judgment
  call with cross-wave consequence (the two-channel failure design: normal
  `CheckResult` failures vs. composition-bug Go errors) is documented
  explicitly in its own section above, not left implicit — a future reader
  extending any one checker should follow the same split rather than
  reintroducing the conflated version this node's own tests caught first.
- No new ADRs, no change-request escalations, and no frozen-contract
  questions this wave. `app.RepositoryCheckpointService.Verify` and
  `app.EvaluationService.ConsumeAuthorization`'s frozen signatures
  (`internal/app/ports.go`) were used exactly as declared, with no
  requested addition.
