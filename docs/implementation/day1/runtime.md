# runtime — Progress Artifact

> **Wave 4 sections appended below the Wave 3 node log** — see "Wave 4"
> heading. Wave 4 adds `runtime-a01` (Part A's migration range 0050-0059,
> this role's first Part A node) and `runtime-b02` (app wiring), and

This is `runtime`'s first progress artifact. Per `agents/runtime.md`, this
role consolidates two internal sub-components — **Part A** (Graceful
Pause, Safe Points, Durable Scheduler) and **Part B** (Application
Orchestration, CLI, Local API). Wave 3's assigned node, `runtime-b01`, is
Part B only; Part A (`internal/pause/**`, `internal/scheduler/**`) is not
touched by this artifact and has no entry here yet.

## Handoff notes (Constitution §6.7 / agents/runtime.md "Handoff")

- **CLI package shape**: `internal/cli.NewRootCmd() *cobra.Command` is the
  single exported entry point, mirroring the constructor convention
  foundation-01 established directly in `cmd/preflight/main.go`
  (`newRootCmd()`/`newVersionCmd()`, unexported because that file is the
  binary's own package). Because `internal/cli` is a separate package
  intended for a future root-wiring step to import, `NewRootCmd` is
  exported; every other constructor in the package
  (`newVersionCmd`, `newHookCmd`, `newHookClaudeCmd`, `newInitCmd`,
  `newEvaluateCmd`, `newDecisionCmd`, `newCheckpointCmd`, `newProgressCmd`,
  `newStateCmd`, `newPauseCmd`, `newResumeCmd`, `newSchedulerCmd`,
  `newStatusCmd`, `newDoctorCmd`) stays unexported, matching the granularity
  of the ports/DTOs they will eventually call.
- **Stub error shape**: every command below `version` returns
  `notImplemented(command string) error` (`internal/cli/errors.go`), which
  builds the frozen `*domain.Error` (`internal/domain/errors.go`,
  `CONTRACT_FREEZE.md` "Error contract") with `Code: ErrCodeUnavailable`,
  `Retryable: true`, and `Details["command"]` set to the dotted command
  path (e.g. `"hook claude user-prompt-submit"`). `ErrCodeUnavailable` was
  chosen over `ErrCodeInternal` deliberately: the command surface itself is
  correct and will work once the corresponding service
  (`EvaluationService`, `ProgressTreeService`, `GracefulPauseService`, etc.
  — `internal/app/ports.go`) is wired by a later node (`runtime-b02`
  onward); this is an operational "not yet available," not a code defect.
  `version` is the sole exception — it has no service dependency
  (`internal/buildinfo.String()` only) and is fully real.
- **Command tree**: `NewRootCmd` registers all 18 P0 leaf commands named in
  `agents/runtime.md` Part B in one call, split across two files for
  readability — `internal/cli/root.go` (root + all commands except the
  `hook` subtree) and `internal/cli/hook.go` (`hook claude {statusline,
  user-prompt-submit, stop, stop-failure}`, kept separate because it is a
  three-level subtree, not a single command, and had enough of its own
  naming-convention context — see below — to warrant its own file and its
  own package doc paragraph).
- **`cmd/preflight/main.go` is untouched.** Per `agents/runtime.md`
  ("Do not edit `cmd/preflight/main.go`; the contract-integrator and
  foundation roles integrate root wiring. Add command constructors under
  owned paths.") and the Wave 3 task brief, this node only builds
  `internal/cli`'s constructors. `cmd/preflight/main.go` still wires only
  `version` (from foundation-01, Wave 1) and does not yet call
  `cli.NewRootCmd()` — that integration is explicitly out of scope for
  this role and belongs to `contract-integrator`/`foundation` in a later
  step. The DAG's validation command was run against the *existing*
  `cmd/preflight` binary (still `version`-only) to confirm `internal/cli`
  compiles cleanly into the module and does not break the existing build;
  `internal/cli`'s own `--help` behavior (the full P0 tree) is verified
  directly at the package level in `internal/cli/root_test.go`'s
  `TestHelpSucceeds`, since there is no owned binary target yet that wires
  the full tree.
- **Dependency requests**: none. Cobra (`github.com/spf13/cobra`) and
  `internal/buildinfo`/`internal/domain` were already available
  (foundation-01, Bootstrap); no new `go.mod` entry was needed.

## Naming-convention judgment call: kebab-case hook subcommands

`docs/implementation/day1/wave2-analysis/ADR_Recommendations.md` REC-03
documents a real, still-open discrepancy: `Preflight_ADD.md` Appendix E.3
spells Claude Code hook subcommands in PascalCase (e.g. `UserPromptSubmit`,
matching Claude's own hook-event-name casing), while `agents/runtime.md`'s
own P0 command list, this node's DAG validation command
(`docs/implementation/day1/EXECUTION_DAG.md` `runtime-b01`'s row), and the
Day-1 execution plan's demo script all independently use kebab-case
(`user-prompt-submit`). REC-03 explicitly names `runtime-b01`'s real CLI
command tree as the first place this decision becomes real, and recommends
resolving it via ADR before this node, not after — that ADR has not been
authored as of this commit.

This node follows **kebab-case** (`preflight hook claude
user-prompt-submit`, `stop-failure`), for two independent reasons:

1. Per Constitution §2's document priority order, `agents/runtime.md` (a
   role-scoped operational document, tier 4) is the most specific document
   that names this role's actual command surface, and it uses kebab-case
   verbatim. `Preflight_ADD.md` (tier 2) is architecturally senior in
   general, but Constitution §1's "one authoritative document per subject"
   table names no single sole source of truth for CLI subcommand string
   casing specifically, and three independently-authored frozen documents
   converging on kebab-case (vs. one on PascalCase) is itself evidence
   about which spelling the rest of the project actually built against
   (`integrations/claude/hooks.json`, per REC-03, already uses kebab-case
   too).
2. This node's own DAG validation command
   (`go build ./internal/cli/... && preflight --help`) does not
   independently test subcommand casing, but the task brief that assigned
   this node was explicit: use kebab-case, matching agents/runtime.md's own
   P0 list, and document the call rather than silently inventing a third
   answer.

**This is not a resolution of REC-03.** No ADR has been written; `runtime`
has no authority to accept one (Constitution §3.2 — only
`contract-integrator` accepts ADRs). If `Preflight_ADD.md` Appendix E.3 is
later confirmed as the intended casing via an accepted ADR, the fix is
mechanical: rename the four `Use` strings in
`internal/cli/hook.go`'s `newHookClaudeCmd` and update
`root_test.go`/`errors_test.go`'s path tables to match — no other file is
affected, since every stub command is otherwise identical regardless of
its `Use` string. Flagging this explicitly so a future wave doesn't have
to rediscover it: **REC-03 should still be raised as a real ADR** even
though this node made a documented, non-blocking judgment call to proceed
under kebab-case in the meantime.

    and should still be resolved by an accepted ADR."
  - "Every command below `version` is an honest stub returning
    domain.Error{Code: ErrCodeUnavailable, Retryable: true} rather than
    any real behavior, per explicit task instruction: none of
    orchestrator/evaluation/checkpoint/pause services exist yet this wave,
    and the DAG's own validation command
    (`go build ./internal/cli/... && preflight --help`) only requires
    `go build` and `--help` to work, not working commands."
  - "internal/cli/root.go groups most P0 leaf commands (version, init,
    evaluate, decision, checkpoint, progress, state, pause, resume,
    scheduler, status, doctor) into a single file rather than one file per
    command. The DAG estimated 6 files/350 LOC for runtime-b01; one file
    per command (13 top-level constructors) would have produced far more
    files than that estimate for what is, this wave, structurally
    identical boilerplate per command (a Use/Short/RunE stub). `hook` was
    split out on its own because it is a three-level subtree with its own
    naming-convention discussion, which justified a dedicated file and
    package-doc paragraph the other commands don't need yet. This may be
    resplit into per-domain files (e.g. a checkpoint.go, a pause.go) once
    real business logic lands behind each command in runtime-b02 onward
    and the single-file grouping stops being the natural shape."
  - "NewRootCmd is exported (capital N) unlike foundation-01's
    unexported newRootCmd in cmd/preflight/main.go, because
    internal/cli is a separate package a future root-wiring step needs to
    import; cmd/preflight/main.go's own newRootCmd stays package-private
    since nothing outside that package needs it. Both conventions coexist
    correctly per Go visibility rules; this is not a contradiction of
    foundation's established pattern, just the same pattern applied at a
    package boundary that didn't exist yet when foundation-01 was written."

# Wave 4

Branch: `day1/runtime`, synced from `main` (Wave 3 integration state,
`664436d`) via fast-forward before any Wave 4 work — required so
foundation-06's migration engine + 0001-0004 core-schema files exist on
this branch. Assigned nodes, executed sequentially: `runtime-a01`
(Part A migrations 0050-0059), then `runtime-b02` (app wiring).

## runtime-a01 — Graceful Pause/Scheduler core migrations

### What shipped

- `internal/storage/sqlite/migrations/0050_pause_records.sql` —
  `pause_records` + `idx_pause_status` (ADD §12.2/§12.3).
- `internal/storage/sqlite/migrations/0051_wake_jobs.sql` — `wake_jobs` +
  `idx_wake_jobs_due`, including `UNIQUE(pause_id, job_kind)` (the
  schema-level exactly-once-wake anchor) and the column set the ADD §12.4
  lease query requires (`status`, `run_after`, `lease_owner`,
  `lease_expires_at`, `attempts`, `max_attempts`).
- `internal/storage/sqlite/migrations/0052_resume_attempts.sql` —
  `resume_attempts` audit-trail table.
- `internal/storage/sqlite/migrations_0050_pause_test.go` — this range's
  tests (all named `TestMigration0050_*` so the DAG's validation command
  `go test ./internal/storage/sqlite/... -run Migration0050` selects
  exactly these): embedded-file loading, apply-from-empty (tables +
  §12.3 indexes present), idempotent re-apply, FK enforcement into
  foundation's `tasks`/`provider_sessions` (reject unknown ids; full
  repository → worktree → task → pause cascade), `runway_forecast_id`
  NOT NULL, wake-job cascade + unique-kind, resume-attempt
  survives-wake-job (SET NULL) but not pause (CASCADE).

### Documented deviation from ADD §12.2 canonical FKs (needs contract-integrator's eye; mirrors the 0004_tasks.sql precedent)

ADD §12.2 declares `pause_records.turn_id/runway_forecast_id/
state_checkpoint_id/repository_checkpoint_id` as `REFERENCES` into
`turns` (claude-provider 0010-0019), `runway_forecasts` (predictor
0040-0049), `state_checkpoints` (checkpoint 0020-0029), and
`repository_checkpoints` (checkpoint 0030-0039). None of those migration
files exist yet. SQLite accepts forward FK declarations at CREATE time,
but with `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` it resolves *every* parent table on
*any* DML touching the child — **including cascade processing initiated
from `repositories`/`worktrees`/`tasks` deletes**. Empirically (first
draft of this node used the canonical FKs): foundation's own
`TestCoreMigrations_ForeignKeys_*` tests immediately failed with
`no such table: main.repository_checkpoints` on a plain
`DELETE FROM repositories`, i.e. the forward FKs would have poisoned
unrelated DML repo-wide and hard-blocked `runtime-a02` (pause state
machine, DAG-scheduled against runtime-a01 alone) on three other roles'
ranges.

Resolution: these four columns ship as plain `TEXT` pointers, exactly the
precedent foundation-06 set for `tasks.active_node_id` → `progress_nodes`
in `0004_tasks.sql`. FKs that *can* be enforced today (into `tasks`,
`provider_sessions`, and within this range `wake_jobs`/`resume_attempts` →
`pause_records`) are declared and tested. **Proposal to
contract-integrator:** once 0010-0049 have all landed, either (a) accept
the plain-pointer precedent permanently (consistent with 0004), or (b)
assign runtime a follow-up migration in its own range (0053+) that
recreates `pause_records` with the canonical FK set via SQLite's
copy-drop-rename pattern. Either way the decision belongs above this role;
this node did not silently pick (a) forever — it picked the only option
that keeps the repo's DML working today, and flagged the choice here.

### CHANGE REQUEST → foundation (Constitution §4.4 — not edited by runtime)

Three assertions in `internal/storage/sqlite/migrate_test.go`
(foundation's file) are over-constrained and fail the moment *any* later
role's migration range lands — which contradicts `migrate.go`'s own
design comment ("later roles' migrations … are picked up automatically
once present, with no change needed here"):

1. `TestAllMigrations_LoadsCoreSchemaFiles` asserts
   `len(migrations) == 4` — should filter to foundation's own 0000-0009
   range (the way `TestMigration0050_AllMigrationsIncludesPauseRange`
   filters to 0050-0059).
2. `TestCoreMigrations_FromEmptyDatabase` asserts `CurrentVersion == 4` —
   should assert `>= 4` or derive the expectation from `AllMigrations()`.
3. `TestCoreMigrations_ReopenFromFile_AppliesOnce` asserts
   `CurrentVersion == 4` — same fix.

Until foundation applies this mechanical fix, `go test
./internal/storage/sqlite/...` (full package, no `-run` filter) reports
these three failures on this branch. **No runtime-owned test fails**, and
the failures are assertion staleness, not behavior: foundation's
FK/cascade/unique behavioral tests all still pass against the combined
0001-0052 schema. Per Constitution §4.4 runtime did not edit the file and
did not wait idle; flagging here for foundation + the merge integrator.

```

## runtime-b02 — App wiring (in-process composition layer)

### What shipped

- `internal/app/wiring/wiring.go` — the composition container:
  `Services` (one field per frozen service interface: `Evaluation`,
  `ProgressTree`, `StateCheckpoint`, `GracefulPause`,
  `RepositoryCheckpoint` — `internal/app/ports.go`), `New(Services)
  (*App, error)` (fail-closed construction: any nil field returns the
  frozen `domain.Error` with `ErrCodeValidation`, `Retryable: false`, and
  `Details["missing_services"]` naming every hole — a composition bug
  surfaces at startup, not as a nil-pointer panic in whichever handler
  first hits it), one accessor per service, and `App.RootCmd()` — the
  wiring→CLI seam that returns `internal/cli.NewRootCmd()`'s tree today
  and is where runtime-b03+ threads real services into individual command
  handlers.
- `internal/testutil/fakes/` — first population of this directory
  (agents/runtime.md: "coordinate with the qa role"): `doc.go`
  (pattern contract), `unconfigured.go` (shared nil-Func behavior), and
  one file per frozen service interface (`evaluation.go`,
  `progresstree.go`, `statecheckpoint.go`, `gracefulpause.go`,
  `repositorycheckpoint.go`). Pattern: `Fake<Interface>` struct with one
  optional `<Method>Func` field per method; compile-time
  `var _ app.X = (*FakeX)(nil)` assertions; calling an unconfigured
  method fails loud with `domain.Error{Code: ErrCodeUnavailable,
  Retryable: false, Details: {fake, method}}` rather than silently
  returning zero values. No call recording/counting machinery — tests
  needing it build it in their own closures (Constitution §7 rule 10:
  no abstractions this milestone doesn't need).
- `internal/app/wiring/wiring_test.go` — validates: construction with
  all-fakes succeeds; each single missing service fails closed with the
  right code/retryability/details; all-missing lists all five; accessors
  return the injected instances (identity); calls through the container
  reach the configured fake closure with arguments intact (pass-through
  plumbing, no re-interpretation); unconfigured fake methods fail loud
  through the container; `RootCmd()` yields the full 13-top-level-command
  P0 tree from runtime-b01.

### Handoff notes

- **For qa**: `internal/testutil/fakes` is intentionally minimal and
  additive-friendly. If integration tests need recording fakes, add
  behavior in test-local closures first; only promote shared machinery
  into this package if several suites independently need the same thing.
- **For contract-integrator/foundation (root wiring)**: the intended
  binary composition is `wiring.New(Services{...real impls...})` followed
  by `app.RootCmd()`. `cmd/preflight/main.go` remains untouched by this
  role per agents/runtime.md.
- **For runtime-b03+ (this role)**: replace `RootCmd`'s direct
  `cli.NewRootCmd()` call by passing `a.services`' interfaces into the
  cli constructors as they gain real handlers; callers that already go
  through `App.RootCmd()` see no change.
