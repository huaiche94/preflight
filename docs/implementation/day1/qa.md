# qa — Progress Artifact

## Handoff notes (Constitution §6.7 / agents/qa.md)

- **CI entry point**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (qa-01). Calls into
  `Taskfile.yml` targets only (`task fmt`, `task lint`, `task build`,
  `task test`, `task test:short`) — it does not invoke `go`/
  `golangci-lint` directly, so any future change to how those checks run
  (e.g. a new lint rule, a new build flag) only needs to change
  `Taskfile.yml`/`Makefile`, not the workflow file, per this node's
  instruction not to duplicate or conflict with `foundation`'s task
  runner. `golangci-lint` itself is installed in CI via
  `golangci/golangci-lint-action@v6` (pinned major version, `version:
  latest` for the tool binary) rather than a bare `go install`, since the
  action also wires GitHub-native lint annotations or a compatible
  config format for `.golangci.yml`'s v2 schema.
- **Race detector platform split**: `task test` (`go test -race ./...`)
  runs on `ubuntu-latest` and `macos-latest`; `windows-latest` runs
  `task test:short` (no `-race`) instead. This is a deliberate,
  documented choice (see the workflow file's inline comment), not an
  oversight — reasoning is in the qa-01 node log's `assumptions` below.
- **No VS Code / JSON Schema / migration-test CI jobs yet**: ADD §30.3
  names `ci.yml` jobs for VS Code lint/test/build, JSON Schema checks,
  docs link/fence checks, and migration tests. None of those trees exist
  yet in this wave (no `vscode/`, no JSON Schema artifacts, no
  `internal/storage/sqlite/migrations/*.sql` — `foundation-06` is still
  pending per `docs/implementation/day1/foundation.md`). Scaffolding CI
  jobs against paths that don't exist would violate Constitution §7 rule
  10 (no abstractions a later milestone needs but this one doesn't) —
  flagged here so whichever future qa/CI node adds those trees also
  extends `ci.yml`, rather than this gap being silently forgotten.
- **`security.yml`, `provider-contract.yml`, `release.yml`**: named in
  ADD §30.3 but out of scope for qa-01 (whose validation target is
  narrowly "CI green on a trivial PR (Ubuntu/macOS/Windows)" per the
  execution DAG). Not created this wave.
- **Governance docs** (qa-08): `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md` at the repository root are
  grounded in `Preflight_ADD.md` §30.7 (Governance) and §30.8 (Security
  disclosure) verbatim where the ADD specifies concrete content, and
  cross-reference each other rather than duplicating normative text —
  see that node's log below for exact provenance of each file's
  content and the LICENSE/NOTICE gap it surfaces as a cross-owner
  defect.

commit: c523650
next_action: qa-08 (governance docs)
assumptions:
  - "Every command the workflow's `run:` steps invoke (`task fmt`, `task
    lint`, `task build`, `task test`, `task test:short`) is a real,
    already-existing target read directly out of Taskfile.yml before
    writing the workflow — none invented. `golangci-lint` itself is not
    called directly in any `run:` step; `task lint` depends on `vet` and
    then shells out to `golangci-lint run ./...` exactly as
    `.golangci.yml`/Taskfile.yml already define it, so the workflow adds
    zero new lint configuration or duplicate rules."
  - "lint/fmt run once on ubuntu-latest only, not across the full OS
    matrix. gofmt/go vet/golangci-lint operate on source text and Go AST,
    which do not vary by host OS (no OS-conditional Go source exists yet
    in this repository via build tags that would change lint output
    cross-platform) - foundation's internal/lock package does have
    process_unix.go/process_windows.go build-tag-split files, but both
    are still plain Go source parsed identically by gofmt/vet/lint
    regardless of which OS the *linter* itself runs on; only *compiling*
    each file requires the matching target OS, which is what the
    build-and-test matrix job (not the lint job) does. Running lint 3x
    for a trivial PR would be pure redundant cost with no additional
    signal, contrary to keeping a 'trivial PR green' check fast."
  - "Race detector: `-race` requires CGO_ENABLED=1 and a working C
    toolchain. ubuntu-latest and macos-latest GitHub-hosted runners ship
    gcc/clang by default, matching this node's task instruction
    ('Windows has some race-detector limitations historically ... run
    race only on ubuntu/macos if that's the safer choice, and document
    why'). windows-latest GitHub-hosted runners do carry a working MinGW
    gcc today, so `-race` would likely run there too, but it has a
    documented history of being the least reliable combination in CI
    (slower instrumentation, occasional flaky failures tied to
    Go-version/MinGW-version pairings, and Go's own release notes have
    called out narrower Windows race-detector support in some past
    versions) - given qa-01's validation bar is 'CI green on a trivial
    PR,' introducing a known flake source on one matrix leg for coverage
    this wave does not yet exploit (no concurrency-heavy code outside
    internal/lock/internal/storage/sqlite exists yet) was judged not
    worth it. Race coverage is not dropped project-wide: two of three
    matrix legs (ubuntu, macos) run the full `-race` suite every PR, and
    `task test:short` still runs the full non-race suite on Windows, so
    a Windows-only compile/logic regression would still be caught, just
    not a Windows-only data race."
  - "golangci-lint is installed in the lint job via
    `golangci/golangci-lint-action@v6` rather than `go install
    .../golangci-lint/v2/cmd/golangci-lint@latest` (the method
    foundation-09 used locally per docs/implementation/day1/foundation.md).
    The action is the documented, cached, GitHub-native way to run
    golangci-lint in Actions and natively understands the v2 config
    schema `.golangci.yml` already uses; `go install` would work too but
    would re-download/re-build the linter from source on every run with
    no built-in caching. `version: latest` keeps it on the v2 line
    (`.golangci.yml` starts with `version: \"2\"`) without hardcoding a
    version number the workflow would need manual upkeep for."
  - "`task`/`golangci-lint` were not preinstalled in this darmin dev
    worktree either (same gap foundation-09 documented on its own dev
    host) - both were available at $(go env GOPATH)/bin because this
    worktree shares the same GOPATH as the main checkout where
    foundation-09 installed them via `go install`; no new install was
    needed for this node beyond adding that directory to PATH for the
    validation session. `actionlint` (not previously installed by any
    role) was newly installed via `go install
    github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest` solely to
    strengthen this node's own YAML/schema validation beyond a bare
    `yaml.safe_load` parse - this is a one-off local validation tool, not
    a repository dependency, and is not referenced by go.mod, Taskfile.yml,
    or the workflow file itself."
  - "`arduino/setup-task@v2` is used to install the `task` binary inside
    the build-and-test job (needed there because that job calls `task
    build`/`task test`), while the lint job only needs `golangci-lint`
    (installed via its own action) plus `task fmt`/`task lint` - so
    `setup-task` is duplicated into both jobs rather than shared, since
    GitHub Actions jobs run on independent, ephemeral runners with no
    shared filesystem state between jobs in the same workflow run."
  - "No `security.yml`, `provider-contract.yml`, or `release.yml` created
    this node - ADD §30.3 names all four but qa-01's own DAG row scope
    (validation: 'CI green on a trivial PR (Ubuntu/macOS/Windows)') is
    the basic build/lint/test workflow only. The other three depend on
    infrastructure (a provider fixture corpus, a release/signing
    pipeline, govulncheck/CodeQL wiring) that doesn't exist yet this
    wave and is scope creep beyond this node."

commit: PENDING_QA08_COMMIT
next_action: none — qa-01 and qa-08 were this wave's full qa assignment; STOP per task instruction
assumptions:
  - "SECURITY.md's disclosure channel is a private GitHub Security
    Advisory with a 3-business-day acknowledgement target, verbatim from
    ADD §30.8 ('Private GitHub Security Advisory; ack target 3 business
    days') - no alternate channel (e.g. a security@ email alias) is
    invented since the ADD names exactly one mechanism and Constitution
    §1 treats the ADD as sole source of truth for this content."
  - "SECURITY.md also enumerates the qa.md role packet's own 'Security
    assertions' list (loopback/API auth, prompt text absent by default,
    bearer token/API key redaction, hook payload size limits, restrictive
    SQLite/artifact permissions, argv-only external commands, extraction
    path-traversal safety, opt-in auto-resume) as the project's current
    security posture / what a report should test against, since qa owns
    both this document and that assertion list, and a security policy
    that doesn't name what's actually verified would be thinner than the
    project's own existing internal bar."
  - "CONTRIBUTING.md requires DCO sign-off (`git commit -s`) and states
    'no CLA' per ADD §30.7 verbatim ('DCO sign-off; no CLA initially').
    It also requires reading CONSTITUTION.md, Preflight_ADD.md, and
    AGENTS.md before proposing changes and describes the
    milestone-gating rule, both copied from README.md's existing
    'Contributing' section (not contradicted, only expanded with the
    concrete local-task commands from ADD §30.2 and the DCO/license
    requirement README.md itself doesn't state) - README.md's own
    'Contributing' section was read first specifically to avoid
    introducing a second, divergent contribution process."
  - "CONTRIBUTING.md's local task list (`task fmt`, `task lint`, `task
    test`, `task build`) is the actually-existing Taskfile.yml subset of
    ADD §30.2's full list (`task bootstrap`, `task test:race`, `task
    test:e2e`, `task vscode:test`, `task research:test`, `task verify`
    are ADD-specified future targets that do not exist in Taskfile.yml
    yet - `vscode/` and `research/` trees don't exist yet either per
    README.md's repository layout). Documenting only the targets that
    actually run today avoids telling a new contributor to run a command
    that will fail; the not-yet-existing ADD-named targets are
    acknowledged in a footnote rather than silently omitted, so
    CONTRIBUTING.md doesn't quietly contradict ADD §30.2's eventual full
    list."
  - "License stated as Apache-2.0 in CONTRIBUTING.md/GOVERNANCE.md,
    matching README.md's Tech stack table ('License: Apache-2.0') - no
    LICENSE file exists in the repository root yet
    (docs/implementation/day1/foundation.md's foundation-09 log flags
    this as a known, not-yet-assigned gap: 'No LICENSE or NOTICE file was
    added even though both are named in foundation's exclusive-paths
    list'). LICENSE/NOTICE are foundation-owned paths per agents/qa.md's
    own exclusive-paths list (LICENSE/NOTICE are not in it), so creating
    them is out of scope here; CONTRIBUTING.md/GOVERNANCE.md state the
    license by name (consistent with README.md) without asserting the
    LICENSE file itself exists, and this gap is re-flagged below for
    contract-integrator/foundation."
  - "CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md is the Contributor Covenant v2.1 verbatim
    (standard, freely reusable, widely adopted text), per this node's
    instruction to adapt a standard well-known CoC since the ADD
    specifies no custom content for this file. Only the enforcement
    contact was filled in, pointed at the same private GitHub Security
    Advisory / repository-owner-contact channel SECURITY.md uses, since
    no separate conduct-specific contact (e.g. a conduct@ email) is
    named anywhere in the ADD or README and inventing one would be an
    unverifiable, likely-dead contact address."
  - "GOVERNANCE.md documents both maturity stages from ADD §30.7
    verbatim: Initial ('lead maintainer + public ADR/issue process') and
    Mature ('>=3 active maintainers; sensitive security/provider changes
    2 approvals; documented release authority; DCO sign-off; no CLA
    initially'), explicitly stated as the *current* stage being Initial
    (matching the repository's actual state: one lead, no maintainer
    team yet) and Mature as the documented future bar, not a
    currently-true claim. It also documents the ADR process from
    CONSTITUTION.md §3 (only contract-integrator accepts an ADR; any role
    may propose one) since governance-of-the-repository and
    governance-of-architecture-decisions are the same subject from a
    contributor's perspective and splitting them across two documents a
    reader has to cross-reference would be worse than one document
    citing CONSTITUTION.md as the source of truth for ADR mechanics
    (avoiding duplicating CONSTITUTION.md's normative text verbatim,
    which would risk drift - CONSTITUTION.md itself is supreme per its
    own §title and only contract-integrator may amend it)."
  - "ADD §30.9 (Privacy governance - changes to raw prompt retention,
    outbound telemetry, auto-resume default, state artifact content, or
    remote checkpoint require privacy review + ADR + changelog) is
    included in GOVERNANCE.md as a named special-review category distinct
    from ordinary sensitive-change review, verbatim from the ADD, since
    it is explicitly a governance rule (who must approve what kind of
    change) rather than a security-disclosure or contribution-process
    rule, so it belongs in GOVERNANCE.md rather than SECURITY.md or
    CONTRIBUTING.md."
blockers:
  - "LICENSE/NOTICE files (ADD §30.1's 'Required files' list) do not yet
    exist in the repository root. Not a qa-08 blocker (out of qa's
    exclusive paths entirely - foundation owns them per its own
    exclusive-paths list), but CONTRIBUTING.md/GOVERNANCE.md both name
    Apache-2.0 as the project license consistent with README.md, and a
    contributor who goes looking for the actual LICENSE file will not
    find one yet. Filed here as a cross-owner defect for
    foundation/contract-integrator per Constitution §4.4 (a role that
    needs a change to a file it doesn't own requests it through its
    progress artifact rather than making the edit itself) - this is a
    re-flag of the same gap foundation-09 already surfaced in its own
    progress artifact, not a new discovery."
