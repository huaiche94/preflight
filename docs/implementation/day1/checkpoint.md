# checkpoint — Progress Artifact

Role covers two internal sub-components (Part A: Progress Tree / State
Checkpointing; Part B: Repository Checkpoint), kept separate per
`agents/checkpoint.md`. This wave, only one node was unblocked and assigned:
`checkpoint-b02`. `checkpoint-a01` and `checkpoint-b01` remain queued behind
`foundation-06` (core SQLite migration harness), which was not complete this
wave — per the frozen `EXECUTION_DAG.md`, both were correctly withheld
rather than started against an incomplete dependency.

```yaml
node: checkpoint-b02
status: completed
artifacts:
  - internal/gitx/runner.go        # domain.ProcessRunner exec.Command-backed impl (argv-only, never a shell string)
  - internal/gitx/client.go        # Client wrapping ProcessRunner with git-specific ops (Status)
  - internal/gitx/resolver.go      # RepoInfo + ResolveRepo: worktree root / git-dir / common-dir resolution via `git rev-parse --path-format=absolute`

commit: 9b222d0
next_action: superseded by the Wave 2 entry below
assumptions:
  - "Status() pins --branch --untracked-files=all --find-renames on top of --porcelain=v2 -z so output is deterministic regardless of the caller's git config (status.renames, status.showUntrackedFiles). This is additive to the exact flag string in the DAG's validation command and does not change the parser's contract."
  - "ParsePorcelainV2 fails closed (returns a domain.Error with ErrCodeValidation) on any record shape it doesn't recognize, rather than silently skipping it — this parser feeds the Repository Checkpoint integrity boundary (Constitution §6), so an unintelligible status must not be treated as 'no changes.'"
  - "ResolveRepo requires git >= 2.31 for `rev-parse --path-format=absolute`; not verified against older git in this environment. Local git version used for tests: 2.37.3."
  - "Unmerged (conflict) entries and ignored entries are parsed by the porcelain layer (fixture-tested) but have no live-repo integration test in this wave, since provoking a real merge conflict/ignore rule in a throwaway temp repo added setup complexity out of proportion to checkpoint-b02's scope; they are covered by TestParsePorcelainV2Fixtures instead. checkpoint-b03/b04 should add a live-repo conflict case if the fingerprint or checkpoint-create logic branches on unmerged state."
blockers:
  - "checkpoint-a01 and checkpoint-b01 blocked pending foundation-06 (core SQLite migration harness) — not started this wave, per explicit wave assignment."

## Wave 2

Assigned node this wave: `checkpoint-b03` (Snapshot fingerprint), dependency
`checkpoint-b02` satisfied on this branch. Per explicit wave instruction, no
merge/rebase onto main was performed (ADR-041 touches only predictor domain
types, nothing `internal/gitx` depends on). `checkpoint-a01`, `checkpoint-b01`,
and `checkpoint-b04` remain unstarted, per assignment.

```yaml
node: checkpoint-b03
status: completed
artifacts:
  - internal/gitx/fingerprint.go      # Fingerprint struct (repo identity, worktree path, branch/HEAD, status entries, index+worktree numstat, untracked policy metadata) + canonical SHA-256 digest + Client.Fingerprint orchestration
  - internal/gitx/numstat.go          # NumstatEntry, Client.DiffNumstat (git diff [--cached] --numstat -z --no-ext-diff --find-renames), ParseNumstatZ fail-closed parser
  - internal/gitx/fingerprint_test.go # determinism/reversibility, worktree/staged/untracked/HEAD change detection, rename, binary, spaced paths, unborn branch, linked worktree, digest order-independence + per-field sensitivity, numstat parse fixtures + fail-closed rejections

  - "go build ./internal/gitx/...                        # OK"
  - "go vet ./internal/gitx/...                          # OK"
  - "go test ./internal/gitx/... -run Fingerprint -v     # PASS, all subtests green (DAG validation command)"
  - "go test ./internal/gitx/... -race                   # PASS, full existing suite unchanged (no regressions)"
  - "go build ./... && go vet ./...                      # whole-repo build/vet unaffected"
commit: 0281b97
next_action: checkpoint-b04 (Repository Checkpoint create/verify) is now unblocked on the b03 side but still gated on checkpoint-b01 (migrations 0030-0039, itself gated on foundation-06) — not started this wave, per assignment
assumptions:
  - "Digest scope: covers FingerprintSchema, WorktreeRoot, CommonDir, IsLinkedWorktree, HeadOID, Branch, UntrackedPolicy, sorted status Entries, and sorted index/worktree numstat. Upstream/Ahead/Behind are carried as informational fields but deliberately EXCLUDED from the digest: they move on `git fetch` (remote-tracking refs), which does not change the local worktree/index/HEAD state that FR-149 resume validation protects — a background fetch must not invalidate a resume. If checkpoint-b04 or runtime needs remote-divergence in the identity, that is an additive schema bump (preflight.gitx.fingerprint.v2), not a breaking change."
  - "Canonical encoding is netstring-style length-prefixed fields hashed in fixed order, with Entries/numstat sorted by (Path, OrigPath[, Kind]) before hashing — digest is independent of git's emission order and immune to path-content boundary forgery (spaces/tabs/newlines in paths are covered by tests)."
  - "A Fingerprint is a point-in-time read composed of three git invocations (status + two numstats), not an atomic capture. Concurrent-mutation detection is the ADD §19.3 initial/final-fingerprint-compare protocol, which is checkpoint-b04/b07 scope; Fingerprint.Equal (digest compare, fail-closed on empty digest) is the primitive those nodes will use."
  - "ParseNumstatZ fails closed (domain ErrCodeValidation) on any unrecognized record shape, matching ParsePorcelainV2's integrity-boundary posture from checkpoint-b02."
  - "`git diff --cached --numstat` on an unborn branch (no commits) diffs against the empty tree — verified against git 2.37.3 and covered by TestFingerprintUnbornBranch, so fingerprinting a freshly-initialized staged repo works."
  - "app.Authorization.SnapshotFingerprint (frozen ports.go) is a plain string; Fingerprint.Digest (sha256 hex) satisfies it directly. No contract gap found; no ports.go change requested."
blockers:
  - "checkpoint-a01, checkpoint-b01 still blocked on foundation-06; checkpoint-b04 additionally on checkpoint-b01. None started this wave, per explicit assignment."
```

Final commit for checkpoint-b03: `0281b97` (code + docs), with this SHA
recorded in a follow-up commit, same pattern as Wave 1's `9b222d0`/`94be461`.

## Corrective commit (cross-role lint finding, not a new DAG node)

A full-tree integration lint pass (golangci-lint, errorlint) over the merged
Wave 2 tree flagged one issue in checkpoint-owned code:
`internal/gitx/resolver_test.go:128` used a direct type assertion
(`err.(*domain.Error)`) inside the `asDomainError` helper, which would fail on
wrapped errors. The helper now delegates to `errors.As`, preserving the exact
same test assertions on the unwrapped `*domain.Error` fields.

Validation re-run and green: `gofmt -l internal/gitx` (empty),
`go build ./internal/gitx/...`, `go vet ./internal/gitx/...`,
`go test ./internal/gitx/... -race`. golangci-lint is not installed in this
environment, so that specific check was skipped; the underlying pattern was
fixed per errorlint's rule. No other files touched; no DAG node started.

## Wave 4

Assigned nodes this wave: `checkpoint-a01` (Part A: Progress Tree core
migrations, 0020-0022) and `checkpoint-b01` (Part B: Repository Checkpoint
core migration, 0030). First Part A work for this role. Pre-step: merged
main (`ca7062f`, Wave 3 integration) into `day1/checkpoint` — clean
fast-forward, whole repo built and tested green before any new work.

### CROSS-ROLE CHANGE REQUEST (Constitution §4.4) — foundation, please fix

Adding ANY migration file outside foundation's 0001-0009 range breaks three
foundation-owned tests in `internal/storage/sqlite/migrate_test.go`, because
they assert the exact embedded migration set rather than foundation's own
subset:

- `TestAllMigrations_LoadsCoreSchemaFiles` — asserts `len(migrations) == 4`
  and the exact list `{1,2,3,4}`;
- `TestCoreMigrations_FromEmptyDatabase` — asserts `CurrentVersion == 4`;
- `TestCoreMigrations_ReopenFromFile_AppliesOnce` — asserts
  `CurrentVersion == 4`.

These now fail on this branch (and will fail for predictor-01's 0040 range
and every later range too). This contradicts migrate.go's own documented
design ("later roles' migrations ... are picked up automatically once
present, with no change needed here"). Requested fix (foundation-owned, one
mechanical edit): filter assertions to foundation's range, e.g. assert the
0001-0009 subset of `AllMigrations()` equals the expected four, and assert
`CurrentVersion >= 4` (or compute the expected max from `AllMigrations()`).
Per Constitution §4 and this wave's explicit instruction ("do NOT touch any
other role's paths"), checkpoint did NOT edit `migrate_test.go`; the three
failures are left in place and flagged here for foundation /
contract-integrator at integration time. checkpoint's own validation
commands (below) pass independently of them.

### checkpoint-a01: Progress Tree core migrations (0020-0022)

```yaml

  - "golangci-lint run ./... (whole repo) -> 0 issues"
next_action: checkpoint-a02/a03 (Progress Tree service + artifact validators) — now unblocked, NOT started this wave per explicit assignment
assumptions:
  - "Only progress_nodes/progress_edges/artifacts land in this node, per the wave instruction. state_checkpoints (also §12.2, also range 0020-0029) is deferred to the wave that implements the State Checkpoint manifest (checkpoint-a05); it will take 0023+. The §12.3 index idx_state_checkpoints_task_created defers with it."
  - "Test file location: migrations_checkpoint_a_test.go lives in foundation's internal/storage/sqlite directory (package sqlite_test) because the DAG's frozen validation command targets ./internal/storage/sqlite/... — the tests cannot live anywhere else and still be selected. It is a NEW, clearly checkpoint-named file; no foundation file was edited. It reuses foundation's openTemp helper (same external test package). If contract-integrator prefers a different convention for per-role migration tests, this file moves wholesale."
  - "All test names carry the Migration0020 selector (the range lower bound stands for the whole a01 migration set) so the DAG's `-run Migration0020` command selects exactly these tests, including the 0021/0022 coverage."
  - "Enum-bearing TEXT columns (progress_nodes.status/kind, progress_edges.edge_kind, artifacts.validation_status) intentionally carry no CHECK constraints: released migrations are immutable (ADD §12.5), so enum vocabulary enforcement belongs to the service layer (checkpoint-a02/a03), not DDL."
  - "UNIQUE(task_id, parent_id, ordinal) does not deduplicate root-level ordinals (SQLite NULL-distinct semantics); §12.2 transcribed verbatim, root-ordinal uniqueness is checkpoint-a02's plan-upsert responsibility. Same NULL-distinct note applies to artifacts' UNIQUE(progress_node_id, uri, sha256) for detached rows."
blockers:
  - "Foundation's three exact-count migration tests fail with this node's files present — see the §4.4 change request above. Not a blocker for this node's own validation command."
```

### checkpoint-b01: Repository Checkpoint core migration (0030)

```yaml
node: checkpoint-b01
status: completed
artifacts:
  - internal/storage/sqlite/migrations/0030_repository_checkpoints.sql  # §12.2 verbatim except turn_id (see assumption)

validation:
  - "gofmt -l internal/storage/sqlite -> empty"

  - "go build ./... && go vet ./... -> clean"
  - "golangci-lint run ./... (whole repo) -> 0 issues"
  - "go test ./... -> green everywhere EXCEPT the 3 pre-documented foundation exact-count tests (see the §4.4 change request at the top of this Wave 4 section; failure message is now 'len(migrations) = 8, want 4')"
next_action: checkpoint-b04 (Repository Checkpoint create/verify) — now unblocked on the b01 side (b03 already done), NOT started this wave per explicit assignment
assumptions:
  - "DOCUMENTED SCHEMA DEVIATION: §12.2 declares turn_id TEXT REFERENCES turns(id) ON DELETE SET NULL, but turns belongs to claude-provider's 0010-0019 range and does not exist yet; an FK to a missing table makes every write to repository_checkpoints fail under PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON until another role ships its schema. turn_id is therefore a plain nullable TEXT pointer, following foundation's identical precedent for tasks.active_node_id (0004_tasks.sql header). Converting it to a real FK later requires a new migration in this range once turns exists (released migrations are immutable, ADD §12.5) — recorded so checkpoint-b04 and contract-integrator's final review both see it."
  - "Only repository_checkpoints lands in this node, per the wave instruction. repository_snapshots and file_changes (which foundation's notes place in the 0030-0039 range) defer to whichever Part B node first needs them (file_changes also FKs turns, so it is doubly blocked); they will take 0031+."
  - "Same no-CHECK-constraint stance as 0020-0022 for status/recoverability enum columns; vocabulary belongs to checkpoint-b04's service layer."
blockers:
  - "Same three foundation exact-count test failures as checkpoint-a01 — single root cause, single requested fix, filed once at the top of this Wave 4 section."
```

Wave 4 pre-step note: the main merge (`git merge main`) resolved as a clean
fast-forward to `ca7062f` (this branch's prior work was already fully
integrated), and the whole repo built and tested green at that point —
the only test regressions on this branch afterward are the three
pre-documented foundation exact-count tests triggered by this wave's own
migration files, exactly as analyzed above.

## Wave 5

Assigned nodes this wave: `checkpoint-a02` (Part A: node state machine +
Progress Tree Go-level stores), `checkpoint-a03` (Part A: artifact
validators), `checkpoint-b04` (Part B: Repository Checkpoint create/verify)
— done sequentially with an independent validate+commit after each, per
explicit wave instruction. Pre-step: `git fetch origin && git merge
origin/main` — clean fast-forward to `5470e4d` (Wave 4's integrated state,
including foundation's fix for the exact-count migration test conflict this
role flagged in its Wave 4 entry above — confirmed resolved: `go test ./...`
was green immediately after the merge, before any new work started).

next_action: checkpoint-a04 (CompleteNode atomic protocol) — the single highest-risk DAG node — is now unblocked on the a02 side (also needs a03 + contract-integrator-04); NOT started this wave per explicit assignment
assumptions:
  - "a01 shipped migrations only (0020-0022 SQL, per its own DAG validation command targeting ./internal/storage/sqlite/...); internal/progress did not exist before this node. a02 is therefore the first Go-level domain package over those tables, exactly as the wave brief anticipated."
  - "State machine extends CONTRACT_FREEZE.md's frozen backbone (pending->ready->in_progress->checkpointing->{completed|failed}) with documented, narrow additions only: pending/ready/paused/blocked -> skipped or blocked as side states; checkpointing -> in_progress for ADD §18.4's validation-fails recovery path; failed -> in_progress as the one explicit retry edge. completed and skipped are the only fully terminal states; failed has exactly one outbound edge (retry), which IsTerminal's doc comment states explicitly rather than leaving implicit."
  - "TransitionStatus's optimistic-concurrency guard (UPDATE ... WHERE status=? AND version=?) is deliberately NOT the full CompleteNode atomic protocol (stage/verify artifact evidence + node update + State Checkpoint creation in one transaction) — that orchestration, and its crash-injection tests, is checkpoint-a04's explicitly scoped job per the wave brief. This node's own concurrent-race test (20 goroutines) validates the store's own concurrency primitive in isolation, not the full completion protocol."
  - "ArtifactStore.Insert's duplicate-evidence conflict only fires on an EXACT (progress_node_id, uri, sha256) repeat (0022's own UNIQUE constraint); a different sha256 for the same (node, uri) is accepted at the store layer by design — surfacing THAT as a completion conflict is Constitution §6.6's concern and checkpoint-a04's job, not this store's. Locked by TestArtifactStore_DifferentSHA256_NotBlockedByStore so a04 doesn't have to rediscover the boundary."

next_action: checkpoint-a04 — unblocked on the a03 side (also needs a02 + contract-integrator-04); NOT started this wave per explicit assignment
assumptions:
  - "Per the DAG note ('Needs real ADD-section fixtures'), fixtures are Preflight_ADD.md §18 transcribed verbatim via `sed`, not synthetic toy Markdown — the negative fixtures are targeted single-line mutations of that same real content, so the validators are proven against real-world Markdown structure (mixed yaml/mermaid/text fences, Chinese-language headings, nested list/prose structure), not a simplified stand-in."
  - "'Valid Markdown section completes and checkpoints' (required test) is scoped, per the wave brief, to 'validator returns success' — TestRegistry_ValidMarkdownSection_CompletesValidation runs file_exists+heading_exists+fence_balance together against the real fixture and asserts all three pass.

  - "HeadingExistsValidator and FenceBalanceValidator share fence-tracking logic (the `fence{char,n}` type and CommonMark's >=-run-length close rule) to guarantee both validators agree on what counts as 'inside a fence' — verified by TestHeadingExists_HeadingTextInsideFence_NotCountedAsHeading, which would fail if the two validators disagreed."

assumptions:
  - "Capture never issues a Git subcommand capable of mutating repository state — grepped for write verbs; only Status/Fingerprint/DiffNumstat/DiffPatch/ListUntracked are called, all read-only.

  - "Cross-platform directory-fsync handling (dirsync_unix.go/dirsync_windows.go, build-tag split) was added because Preflight's own ADD §30.4 release targets include windows/amd64+arm64, and a naive syscall.ENOTSUP reference would not compile there — verified via GOOS=windows go build ./... in addition to the native darwin build."
  - "Service.resolveWorktree is an injected callback (WorktreeLocation) rather than this package reaching into foundation's worktrees table directly — internal/repocheckpoint does not own that table and the wave's cross-part-boundary note (agents/checkpoint.md) already establishes that Part B does not reach into other roles' storage directly; the runtime role (or a future checkpoint node) supplies the real resolver."

## Wave 6

Assigned nodes this wave: `checkpoint-a04` (Part A: CompleteNode atomic
protocol — the single most consequential node in the whole DAG),
`checkpoint-b05` (Part B: binary-safe patch generation edge cases),
`checkpoint-b06` (Part B: untracked file policy secret filters +
`internal/redact`) — done sequentially with an independent validate+commit
after each, per explicit wave instruction, with a04 given the fullest
attention per the DAG's own risk annotation. Pre-step: `git fetch origin &&
git merge origin/main` — clean fast-forward to `abce1d0` (Wave 5's
integrated state: predictor/runtime/orchestrator/pause/scheduler work from
other roles, nothing touching this role's paths); `go test ./...` was green
immediately after the merge, before any new work started.

assumptions:
  - "internal/app/ports.go has no EventPublisher/EventSink port yet (grepped: none exists anywhere in internal/app or pkg/protocol) — adding one is contract-integrator's call per Constitution §4, not this role's to make unilaterally. CompleteNode therefore declares its OWN narrow EventPublisher interface (internal/progress, satisfied trivially by NoopPublisher) rather than blocking on a contract change or reaching past the frozen ports.go; if a future contract freeze adds a matching app.EventPublisher port, this interface's method set is designed to be satisfied by it unchanged."
  - "State Checkpoint manifest lives in a NEW package (internal/statecheckpoint, exclusive path already granted to this role in agents/checkpoint.md) rather than inside internal/progress — mirrors the existing internal/artifacts seam CompleteNode also calls into, keeping 'orchestration' (internal/progress) separate from 'the thing being orchestrated' (manifest assembly/serialization) as two independently testable packages, per this role's own established pattern from a02/a03."
  - "Migrations 0023 (state_checkpoints, deferred from a01 by a01's own note) and 0024 (node_completions, new) both land in this node since CompleteNode cannot be built without either table — a01's deferral note anticipated exactly this."
  - "Idempotency has two layers: CompleteNodeRequest.IdempotencyKey (frozen by CONTRACT_FREEZE.md, caller-supplied) is checked against a durable ledger keyed by node_id (a node can only complete once, ever — PRIMARY KEY node_id on 0024); a second payloadDigest (this protocol's own SHA-256 over node_id + sorted artifact URI/sha256 pairs) detects a caller reusing the SAME key with DIFFERENT evidence, which the frozen key alone cannot distinguish from a legitimate replay."
  - "Concurrent-completion race resolution: NodeStore.TransitionStatus's existing optimistic-concurrency guard (checkpoint-a02, UPDATE...WHERE status=? AND version=?) is what actually arbitrates two concurrent Run() calls; CompleteNode adds a POST-conflict fallback (re-check the idempotency ledger before propagating a raw conflict) specifically for the same-key/same-payload case, so N concurrent identical requests all succeed (one does real work, the rest transparently replay) rather than N-1 of them failing with a conflict they did nothing wrong to deserve. Different-key concurrent attempts on the same node correctly resolve to exactly one winner and N-1 fail-closed losers."
  - "A genuine data race was found (via `-race`) in this node's OWN test double, not in CompleteNode: the first version of the concurrent-race test's deterministic seqIDGenerator used a bare `g.n++`, which is not concurrency-safe, unlike the real production idgen.UUIDv7 (stateless). Fixed with sync/atomic. Recorded here explicitly because it is exactly the kind of finding `-race` exists to catch, and because a fake/test-double concurrency bug can otherwise be mistaken for (or mask) a real one."

### checkpoint-b05: Binary-safe patch generation edge cases

next_action: checkpoint-b07 (atomic write -race hardening, cross-process crash-injection) — NOT started this wave per explicit assignment
assumptions:
  - "The required 'apply round-trip' test (generate a patch, apply it to a fresh checkout, verify the result matches) is proven by cloning the source repo (via argv-only `git clone`/`git apply`, never a shell string) into a separate temp directory checked out at the SAME base commit the patch was diffed against, then comparing file bytes — a filesystem COPY rather than a real clone would not exercise `git apply`'s actual blob-resolution logic (--full-index's whole point) the same way."
  - "'Large diffs' is interpreted as two distinct shapes per this node's own brief ('very large binary diffs' implies large-content, and the DAG note separately says 'many files'): a many-files-many-lines changeset (50 files x 200 lines, patch header count asserted exactly) AND a single very-large-file diff (5000 changed lines) — both proven to apply cleanly, since a many-file bug (ordering/truncation across files) and a single-large-file bug (hunk-boundary miscalculation) are different failure modes."
  - "No production code in internal/gitx or internal/repocheckpoint needed to change — DiffPatch's existing --binary --full-index --no-ext-diff flags (checkpoint-b04) were already exactly correct for every edge case this node tested; this is a genuine 'the hard part was proving it, not building it' node, unlike most of this role's other nodes."

### checkpoint-b06: Untracked file policy secret filters + internal/redact

```yaml
node: checkpoint-b06
status: completed
artifacts:
  - internal/redact/doc.go           # package-level scope statement: exactly what this package covers and does NOT cover, written explicitly for qa-05's benefit (this node's own DAG note: "Feeds qa-05 leakage scanner")
  - internal/redact/filename.go      # MatchesSecretFilename: ADD §27.8's 11 name patterns verbatim, matched against base filename only
  - internal/redact/patterns.go      # 6 content-detector classes verbatim (bearer token, PEM private-key header, GitHub/OpenAI/Anthropic token shapes, Azure storage keys, JWT-like, password/connection-string), each one fixed regexp

  - internal/redact/*_test.go        # filename_test.go, patterns_test.go, scan_test.go — 25 tests total, one subtest per ADD §27.8 detector plus boundary cases (empty file, nonexistent file, content-beyond-cap, binary-content-not-scanned)
  - internal/repocheckpoint/security.go   # +2 new SkipReason values: secret_filename, secret_content (distinct so an operator auditing skipped-files.json can tell which class fired)
  - internal/repocheckpoint/archive.go    # buildUntrackedArchive now takes a scanSecrets bool and calls internal/redact after the existing size caps, before archiving; a match is skipped with the specific new SkipReason, feeding the SAME skip-ledger/partial-recoverability machinery checkpoint-b04 already built (no redesign)
  - internal/repocheckpoint/capture.go     # CaptureOptions.DisableSecretScan: explicit, off-by-default opt-out (zero value = scanning ON)
  - internal/repocheckpoint/untracked_test.go  # 7 new tests: secret-filename exclusion, secret-content exclusion, multiple detector shapes in one capture, no-secrets-full-recoverability negative case, opt-out honored, and an explicit test documenting the scope boundary (secret scan applies to the untracked archive only, NOT to already-tracked diff content captured via DiffPatch)

  - "go vet ./internal/repocheckpoint/... ./internal/redact/... -> OK"
  - "go test ./internal/repocheckpoint/... ./internal/redact/... -run Untracked -v -> PASS (15 repocheckpoint tests incl. the 7 new secret-filter tests + all pre-existing path-safety tests; redact package reports 'no tests to run' for this exact filter since none of its own test names contain the literal substring \"Untracked\" — its full suite is exercised separately and is green)"

commit: ef59034
next_action: checkpoint-b07/b08/b09 — NOT started this wave per explicit assignment. Nothing else deliberately deferred from this node's own scope: filename + content detection are both real (not stubbed), wired into the actual archive path (not just a standalone library nobody calls), and the documented boundary (doc.go) tells qa-05 exactly what this layer does and does not catch.
assumptions:
  - "internal/redact implements EXACTLY Preflight_ADD.md §27.8's two lists (name patterns, content detectors) — transcribed, not invented or extended, so there is a single source of truth for what 'the secret filter policy' means and no drift between this package and the ADD. Detector regexes were validated against realistic-length synthetic fixtures (e.g. an 88-char base64 Azure key, matching Azure's real key length) rather than hand-wavy short placeholders, after an initial manual sanity check caught a too-short test fixture silently under-testing the Azure detector."
  - "Content scanning is capped at 1 MiB per file and skips content identified as binary via Git's own NUL-byte heuristic — both documented as explicit, non-silent boundaries in doc.go, not just implementation details; a secret past the cap or inside binary content is a known gap, not an unstated one."
  - "The secret scan applies ONLY to the untracked-file archive (ADD §19.5's own scope for the 'secret scan' bullet) — NOT to tracked-file diff content captured via DiffPatch (checkpoint-b04/b05's scope). This boundary is deliberate (redacting already-committed history is a different problem than filtering what NEW untracked evidence a checkpoint captures) and is locked in by an explicit test (TestCapture_Untracked_SecretScan_NeverAppliesToTrackedDiffContent) rather than left as an unstated implicit scope decision a later reader would have to infer."
  - "CaptureOptions.DisableSecretScan is a bool (not *bool) with scanning-enabled as its zero value — chosen so a caller that never touches this field (every existing call site, and any future one that doesn't know this option exists) gets the safe default, matching this same struct's existing size-cap fields' zero-value-safe pattern from checkpoint-b04."
blockers: none
```

Final validation after all three Wave 6 nodes together: `golangci-lint run
./...` (whole repo) → 0 issues; `go build ./...` → OK; `go test ./... -race`
→ green across every package, zero regressions from any of this wave's
three nodes.

## Wave 7

Assigned nodes this wave: `checkpoint-a05` (Part A: StateCheckpointService
implementation), `checkpoint-a07` (Part A: duplicate/out-of-order provider
event handling), `checkpoint-b07` (Part B: atomic-write cross-process crash

independent validate+commit after each, per explicit wave instruction.
Pre-step: `git fetch origin && git merge origin/main` — clean fast-forward
to `1440f4c` (Wave 6's integrated state, including predictor/runtime's
pause/policy/scheduler work from other roles, nothing touching this role's

commit: 26c6496
next_action: checkpoint-a06/a08/a09 — NOT started this wave per explicit assignment
assumptions:
  - "checkpoint-a04's own lessons-learned note anticipated this exactly: 'much of a05's nominal scope (manifest serialization/checksum) was ALREADY built here since CompleteNode structurally required it; a05 should verify what remains, likely just Snapshot/verify-API polish.' Confirmed on inspection: manifest.go/serialize.go/build.go/store.go (a04) already fully implement the manifest shape, digest, and CRUD; this node's actual scope was exactly the frozen app.StateCheckpointService port implementation itself, which did not exist as a concrete type yet."
  - "Create is a NEW, standalone ad hoc snapshot entry point (Service.Create), deliberately separate from CompleteNode's own inline checkpoint-on-completion transaction (complete_node.go, unchanged) — it exists for callers (e.g. a manual 'checkpoint now' request, or a future runtime persist-phase wiring) that need a checkpoint of the CURRENT Progress Tree state without also completing a node. Reuses the exact same Build/Seal/Marshal/Store primitives CompleteNode already proved correct."
  - "TreeReader (new interface, NodeSnapshot/ArtifactSnapshot narrow view types) is Service's injected seam for reading current Progress Tree state, deliberately NOT importing internal/progress directly — internal/progress already imports internal/statecheckpoint (complete_node.go), so the reverse import would be a cycle. Production wiring (a later integration step, out of this node's scope) supplies a real adapter over *progress.NodeStore/*progress.ArtifactStore; this node's own tests use an in-memory fake. Same 'injected callback rather than reach into another sub-component's storage directly' discipline checkpoint-b04 established for Service.resolveWorktree."
  - "Verify recomputes the manifest's digest from scratch and compares against the stored integrity_sha256 column, never trusting the stored value alone — mirrors internal/repocheckpoint's Service.Verify 'never trust a stored checksum alone' discipline (checkpoint-b04), applied here to Part A's manifest instead of Part B's artifacts. An unparseable manifest reports Valid:false (fail-closed) rather than propagating a plumbing error, matching this codebase's established fail-open-vs-fail-closed contract (CONTRACT_FREEZE.md: a state-integrity failure must fail closed, and Valid:false for an unparseable manifest IS the fail-closed answer)."
  - "Compile-time assertion: var _ app.StateCheckpointService = (*Service)(nil) in service.go, plus service_test.go additionally exercises Service through the app.StateCheckpointService interface type directly (not just the concrete type), so a signature drift would fail to compile in the test file too."

### checkpoint-a07: duplicate/out-of-order provider event handling

  - internal/progress/complete_node.go              # checkParentOrdering + startedStatuses: rejects a completion signal for a child node whose parent has never reached a "started" status

  - "golangci-lint run ./internal/progress/... -> 0 issues"
  - "go test ./... -race -> green whole-repo"
commit: 49efd06
next_action: feeds qa-04 (duplicate/out-of-order test) directly — public API is CompleteNode.Run itself (no new exported surface needed); qa-04 can drive the exact same scenarios (different-key-same-evidence redelivery, child-before-parent-started) through this same entry point. checkpoint-a06/a08/a09 NOT started this wave per explicit assignment.
assumptions:
  - "Scope boundary versus a04: a04 already fully proved idempotency-KEY matching (same key -> same result; conflicting payload under the same key -> rejected) — NOT re-tested here, per the wave brief's explicit instruction. a07's genuine increment is two things a04 did not cover: (1) duplicate detection independent of key (a provider redelivering the same event through a different channel that derives its own key), and (2) parent/child ordering (a04 only checked depends_on edges via checkDependencies, never parent_id)."
  - "Constitution §6.6 says 'duplicate completion with CONFLICTING evidence is rejected' — read literally, this means duplicate completion with IDENTICAL evidence is NOT a conflict, regardless of which idempotency key arrived with it. checkDuplicateProviderEvent implements exactly this: a key mismatch alone no longer auto-rejects; the evidence digest is compared first, and only a genuine digest mismatch rejects as a conflict. This is a real, deliberate behavior change from a04's original always-reject-on-key-mismatch posture, not a bug — a04's own test asserting the old behavior (TestCompleteNode_AlreadyCompleted_DifferentKey_Rejected) used IDENTICAL evidence for both calls, which was actually the correct fixture for the NEW test's assertion (replay, not reject) rather than the old one; renamed and given genuinely different evidence so it still exercises the real conflict path it was meant to guard."
  - "checkParentOrdering treats in_progress/checkpointing/completed/failed/paused as 'parent has started'; only pending/ready/blocked count as 'not started yet' and trigger the out-of-order rejection. Deliberately does NOT enforce strict start-then-finish ordering between parent and child (a parent legitimately completing slightly before a straggling child's own evidence finishes staging is an allowed race per the existing state machine, proven by TestCompleteNode_ChildCompletes_ParentAlreadyCompleted_Allowed) — the check is specifically about a parent that never started at all, matching the DAG's own framing ('before its parent's in-progress transition is recorded')."
  - "Out-of-order rejection uses ErrCodeConflict with Retryable:true (unlike the dependency-policy and idempotency-conflict rejections elsewhere in this file, which are Retryable:false) — a genuinely out-of-order signal is expected to resolve itself once the parent's own in-progress event catches up, so a caller retrying later is the correct, expected recovery path, not a permanent failure."
  - "No cross-role contract gap found; no ports.go change requested. Both changes are entirely internal to internal/progress's own orchestration logic, calling only stores/seams this role already owns."

commit: 5f853d9
next_action: checkpoint-b08 (RestoreDryRun), checkpoint-b09 (path traversal/symlink security gate) — NOT started this wave per explicit assignment
assumptions:
  - "Crash injection follows internal/progress's CompleteNode.HaltAfter/HaltError pattern (checkpoint-a04) exactly, adapted from a struct field (CompleteNode is a long-lived service value) to a function parameter (writeArtifactDir is a free function with no receiver) — same 'named phase + halt hook as a first-class testing seam' philosophy, not a redesign."
  - "The existing error-path cleanup in writeArtifactDir (the `defer os.RemoveAll(tempDir)` on a non-halt error) is explicitly NOT triggered by a halt — a writeArtifactDirHaltError is a SIMULATED crash (the point is that real production code never gets a chance to run its own cleanup when genuinely killed), so the halt path skips that defer's cleanup on purpose, leaving a real orphan on disk for orphanscan.go to find, exactly mirroring what a real kill -9 would leave behind."
  - "ScanOrphanedTempDirs takes an explicit minAge + now(time.Time) rather than hardcoding a duration or using time.Now() internally, so (1) a startup check can use minAge=0 (nothing is in flight yet, process just started) while a long-running daemon integration can use a conservative minAge (e.g. a few minutes) to avoid racing a live capture, and (2) tests get deterministic, non-flaky age comparisons. This mirrors this role's own established Clock-injection discipline (domain.Clock everywhere else in this codebase) applied to a plain time.Time parameter here since this package doesn't thread domain.Clock through its free functions."
  - "Every temp directory is unconditionally safe to remove once past minAge: by construction, nothing durable (no DB row via internal/repocheckpoint.Store, no manifest.json under a FINAL path) ever references a .checkpoint-tmp-* path — only the post-rename finalDir is ever recorded anywhere durable. This was verified by inspection of every writer of repository_checkpoints and every reader of ArtifactsRoot in this package, not merely assumed."
  - "Retry-after-crash (TestAtomicWrite_RetryAfterCrash_SucceedsCleanly) confirms writeArtifactDir's existing finalDir-collision guard (checkpoint-b04) does not also block on a stale sibling temp dir — each call gets its own os.MkdirTemp-randomized name, so an orphan from a prior crash never prevents a fresh, correct retry for the same checkpoint ID. This is a load-bearing property orphanscan.go's cleanup depends on: retries must keep working even before a cleanup sweep ever runs."
  - "Out of this node's explicit scope, confirmed by re-reading capture.go's own doc comment: the retry-ONCE-on-race-detected POLICY (distinct from this node's crash/orphan scope) that an earlier draft of capture.go's comment also attributed to checkpoint-b07 is NOT built here — this wave's assignment prompt scoped b07 explicitly to 'atomic-write cross-process crash-injection and startup orphan-temp-dir scanning' only, matching checkpoint-b04's own lessons-learned note precisely. Flagging this for whichever later node (b08/b09, or a follow-up) is meant to own the race-retry-policy, since capture.go's in-code comment currently points at a b07 that did not build it."

## Wave 8

Pre-step: `git fetch origin && git merge origin/main` — clean fast-forward
to `2b7c29c` (Wave 7's integrated state, including `qa`'s leakage-scanner
integration test suite and `predictor`/`runtime`'s evaluation/pause work
from other roles, nothing touching this role's own paths ahead of time).

Assigned this wave: one corrective fix (qa-05's `TestLeakageScanner_KnownGap_
SecretInTrackedFileDiffIsNotFiltered` finding, which independently confirmed
this role's own `untracked_test.go` boundary note) plus three new DAG nodes
— `checkpoint-a06`, `checkpoint-a08`, `checkpoint-b08` — done sequentially
with an independent validate+commit after each, per explicit wave
instruction.

### Corrective fix: extend secret scanning to tracked-file diff content

  - internal/repocheckpoint/patchredact.go             # redactPatchSecrets: line-scoped secret redaction over a binary-safe patch (added/removed lines only, never context/header lines, so the patch stays git-apply-able)
  - internal/repocheckpoint/patchredact_internal_test.go  # unit coverage of the line-scope rules directly (added-line redacted, removed-line redacted, context-line never touched, file-header lines never mistaken for content, multi-hunk/multi-file isolation, empty-patch no-op)
  - internal/repocheckpoint/capture.go                 # wires redactPatchSecrets into both staged/unstaged patch generation before archiving; records a Recoverability.Warnings entry when redaction occurred (Level stays complete — a redacted patch is still fully present and applicable, not missing evidence)
  - internal/repocheckpoint/untracked_test.go           # TestCapture_Untracked_SecretScan_NeverAppliesToTrackedDiffContent (asserted the OLD gap as deliberate scope) renamed/rewritten to TestCapture_Untracked_SecretScan_AlsoAppliesToTrackedDiffContent (asserts the fix)

The gap that test documents is closed; updating its assertion is qa's to do in a future node, not this role's to touch."
commit: f981bde
next_action: checkpoint-a06 (this wave's Node 1)
assumptions:
  - "Design choice — redact-in-place, not skip-with-manifest-annotation. ADD §19.3's Capture sequence places 'secret/size/symlink filters' (step 8) generally between diff generation (5-6) and archival (9), not scoped narrowly to untracked files the way §19.5's own 'Untracked policy' section states its secret-scan bullet — read as license to close the gap for patch content too, not to treat the boundary as fixed. Redaction was chosen over skip-with-annotation because: (1) §19.6 Restore (dry-run and any future real restore) needs `git apply --check` against the staged/unstaged patches — skipping the whole patch on one detected secret line would leave NOTHING to restore-check for that entire scope, not just the sensitive line; (2) a staged/unstaged diff is one unified patch blob per side (unlike untracked files, individually excludable candidates in a zip), so skipping it would discard every unrelated legitimate change in the same patch, a much larger evidence loss than the untracked path's per-file skip."
  - "Redaction scope is deliberately narrow: only '+'/'-' line BODIES that individually match internal/redact's content detectors are replaced with a fixed placeholder; context lines (leading space) and all header lines (diff --git/index/---/+++/@@ hunk headers) are never touched, because context lines must match the target file exactly for `git apply` to locate a hunk — rewriting one would silently corrupt the patch's own applicability. This was verified, not just reasoned about: patch_test.go's existing apply-round-trip tests (checkpoint-b05, unmodified by this fix) still pass unchanged, proving ordinary (non-secret) patches round-trip exactly as before."
  - "Binary patches (`GIT binary patch` directives) are untouched by construction: a binary literal-diff line is never '+'/'-' prefixed content in the shape redactPatchSecrets scans, so no special-case was needed."
  - "IndexDiffHash/WorktreeDiffHash (manifest Snapshot block) are now computed from the REDACTED patch bytes, not the raw gitx.DiffPatch output — consistent with 'the hash should reflect what is actually archived,' and avoids a digest that could not be reproduced by re-hashing the checkpoint's own on-disk artifact."

commit: 8ecc0cc (copyloopvar lint fix: 2ecd8f6)
next_action: checkpoint-a08 (this wave's Node 2)
assumptions:
  - "Traced exactly which crash windows exist in Create's own sequence rather than assuming a generic 'staged-artifact-vs-DB' shape (that is internal/progress.Reconciler's DIFFERENT, already-solved problem for CompleteNode, checkpoint-a04): Create has exactly ONE phase where durable state exists at all (PhaseInsert, a single SQL statement SQLite commits atomically — no half-inserted-row state is reachable, unlike internal/repocheckpoint's multi-file artifact writes). PhaseReadTree and PhaseSeal are both pure no-ops from a durability standpoint: nothing to reconcile because nothing was written."
  - "Reconcile is therefore a read-only integrity SCAN, not a repair mechanism — there is nothing for it to fix, by construction, since the only durable-state phase is one atomic statement. This mirrors internal/repocheckpoint.Verify and internal/progress.Reconciler both being diagnostic-only, never self-healing writers."
  - "Deliberately a SEPARATE Reconciler type from internal/progress.Reconciler (checkpoint-a04), not a shared one — the two target genuinely different crash windows (Part A's own node-completion staged-artifact/DB gap vs. this package's own Create-sequence gap) and forcing them into one abstraction would blur that boundary for no benefit."
  - "Crash-injection tests prove the negative exhaustively (every phase, not just one) rather than asserting a single happy path — the all-phases subtest loop is the direct 'genuine crash-injection harness proving no orphaned/dangling state survives startup' deliverable this node's own DAG risk note calls for."

### checkpoint-a08: Snapshot/LoadLatest/Verify APIs — Snapshot increment

```yaml
node: checkpoint-a08

artifacts:
  - internal/statecheckpoint/service.go       # adds Service.Snapshot(ctx, id) (domain.StateCheckpoint, error) — point-in-time read by ID, distinct from LoadLatest (task-scoped, latest-only) and Verify (pass/fail verdict only, no reconstructed state)
  - internal/statecheckpoint/snapshot_test.go # proves Snapshot returns an OLDER checkpoint's own state correctly even after a newer one exists for the same task, agrees with LoadLatest when asked for the latest ID, shares the frozen not-found contract, is consistent with (but distinct from) Verify

commit: 905c298
next_action: checkpoint-b08 (this wave's Node 3)
assumptions:
  - "Checked what a05 already delivered before assuming greenfield scope, per this wave's explicit instruction: LoadLatest and Verify were both already fully implemented and tested (checkpoint-a05). The genuine incremental gap this node's own validation filter (Snapshot|LoadLatest|Verify) implies is a 'give me the full state as of checkpoint X' point-in-time read by ID — neither existing method answers that (LoadLatest is task-scoped and always the newest row; Verify returns only {ID, Valid}, no reconstructed manifest)."
  - "Snapshot is NOT part of the frozen app.StateCheckpointService interface (Create/LoadLatest/Verify only) — added as a package-level method on the concrete *Service type instead, the same way Reconciler/NewReconciler (checkpoint-a06) are additions outside the frozen port. ports.go was not touched."
  - "Snapshot is a plain read, like LoadLatest — it does not itself recompute/verify the integrity digest; a caller wanting the fail-closed guarantee calls Verify separately against the same ID. Proven explicitly by a dedicated consistency test."

### checkpoint-b08: Restore dry-run

```yaml
node: checkpoint-b08
status: completed
artifacts:

  - internal/gitx/patch_test.go                   # ApplyCheck coverage: clean patch reset-to-base applies cleanly and mutates nothing, diverged/conflicting content correctly reports WouldApply:false with Git's own diagnostic detail, empty-patch no-op, unstaged (working-tree) scope

commit: bedd7a7
next_action: checkpoint-b09 (path traversal/symlink security gate) — NOT started this wave per explicit assignment; real restore (mutating) remains explicitly out of Day-1 scope per this node's own DAG risk note
assumptions:
  - "git apply --check semantics required a genuine correction mid-node: an initial test wrote a patch, then immediately ran ApplyCheck against the SAME already-staged index the patch was generated from — which fails, correctly, because the index has already moved PAST the patch's own pre-image ('before' state no longer exists to match against). This is not a bug in ApplyCheck; it is the realistic restore scenario being asked the wrong question. Fixed by resetting the index/working tree back to the patch's own base before dry-running the check — the actual scenario a restore dry-run answers ('if the target were at the patch's base, would this still apply'), verified against real `git apply --check` behavior in a scratch repo before committing to the permanent test suite."
  - "RepositoryIdentityMatch checks manifest.Repository.RepositoryID against a caller-supplied expectedRepositoryID (freshly resolved for the SAME WorktreeID via the same resolveWorktree seam Service.Create uses), NOT GitHead — HEAD legitimately moves between capture and a later restore attempt, and a stale HEAD is exactly what the apply-check step already covers; conflating the two would make ordinary, expected drift look like an identity problem."
  - "WouldSucceed (the free function's own verdict) deliberately excludes the dirty-target check — RestoreDryRun has no AllowDirty policy input to decide that condition with. Service.Restore (which DOES receive AllowDirty via the frozen RestoreRepositoryCheckpointRequest) is where the dirty-target veto is actually applied: true only demotes a dirty finding from a blocking problem to a non-issue, every OTHER problem (checksum/identity/apply-check) still blocks regardless."
  - "RestoreResult{ID, Applied} has no room for a rich problem report (frozen, cannot be amended — ports.go is contract-integrator-owned) — Applied is always false (dry-run never mutates, whether or not the dry-run would have succeeded), and a dry-run that finds problems returns a non-nil ErrCodeConflict domain.Error with every problem individually keyed in Details, giving a caller actionable diagnostics without a new frozen type."
  - "A patch-artifact load/decompress failure (e.g. a tampered gzip stream) is reported as a dry-run PROBLEM in the returned report, not returned as a hard Go error — the same corruption checksum verification (step 1) already flagged; a dry-run's whole purpose is to report findings, not abort before producing one."

Final validation after the corrective fix and all three Wave 8 nodes together:
`golangci-lint run ./...` (whole repo) → 0 issues; `go build ./...` → OK;
`go vet ./...` → OK; `go test ./... -race` → green across every package
except `internal/integrationtest`'s `TestLeakageScanner_KnownGap_
SecretInTrackedFileDiffIsNotFiltered`, which now fails — expected and
intentional, since this wave's corrective fix closes the exact gap that
test documents; per that test's own comment, updating its assertion is
qa's to do in a future node, not this role's to touch (the file is
qa-owned and was only read, never edited, this wave).

## Wave 9 — final gate nodes: checkpoint-a09, checkpoint-b09

Pre-step: `git fetch origin && git merge origin/main` — clean fast-forward
to `36e7ffb` (Wave 8's integrated state, including `qa`'s update to the
LeakageScanner test reflecting this role's own tracked-diff redaction fix,
and `predictor`/`runtime` Wave 8 work from other roles, nothing touching
this role's own paths). `go test ./... -race` was green immediately after
the merge (including the previously-expected-failing LeakageScanner test,
now passing since qa updated its assertion), before any new work started.

Assigned this wave: `checkpoint-a09` (Part A final integration gate) then
`checkpoint-b09` (Part B final security gate) — the last two DAG nodes
assigned to this role, done sequentially with an independent
validate+commit after each, per explicit wave instruction. Both are
explicitly framed by `agents/checkpoint.md`/`EXECUTION_DAG.md` as
cross-cutting proofs that the full stack already built in Waves 1-8 holds
together end to end, not new features — completing them closes out this
role's ENTIRE assigned DAG scope (a01-a09, b01-b09).

### checkpoint-a09: Part A final integration gate

```yaml
node: checkpoint-a09
status: completed
artifacts:

  - "go test ./... -race -> green whole-repo, zero regressions"
  - "golangci-lint run ./internal/progress/... ./internal/statecheckpoint/... -> 0 issues"
commit: (recorded below)
next_action: checkpoint-b09 (this wave's second and final node)
assumptions:
  - "Pure test-only node, deliberately: every earlier a04-a08 node already built the real production mechanism (CompleteNode's atomic protocol, Service.Create/Snapshot/LoadLatest/Verify, both packages' own Reconcilers); a09's job per its own DAG framing is proving those pieces compose correctly end to end using the REAL implementations, not adding a new one. No file outside this single new test file was touched."
  - "realTreeReader (test-local, in complete_node_integration_test.go, NOT production code) adapts the REAL *progress.NodeStore/*progress.ArtifactStore to statecheckpoint.TreeReader, deliberately replacing service_test.go's in-memory fakeTreeReader for this file's own tests — the whole point of this node is exercising the actual stack, not a stand-in. This is exactly the 'production wiring layer' internal/statecheckpoint's own doc comments (checkpoint-a05) anticipated a later integration step would supply; this node IS that integration proof, kept test-local since no wiring package/cmd exists yet in this role's own paths to hold it permanently."
  - "Proof 1 (100-node extension): reused the exact same 100-sequential-nodes shape as checkpoint-a04's original required test, but added a second pass over all 100 resulting checkpoint IDs calling Service.Snapshot (a08) and Service.Verify (a05) on each — a04's original test only called the package-level statecheckpoint.Unmarshal/Verify functions directly against the raw store row, never exercising the Service layer's own API surface a real caller (runtime, or a future CLI) would actually use. Also cross-checked LoadLatest agrees with the 100th checkpoint, and ran both Reconcilers once over the resulting history as a baseline (non-crash) sanity check reused by proof 3's crash scenario."
  - "Proof 2 (cross-package concurrent race): deliberately DIFFERENT nodes per writer goroutine (30 workers), not the same node — checkpoint-a04's own race tests already fully proved the same-node case (optimistic-concurrency arbitration via NodeStore.TransitionStatus). The genuine new shape here is concurrent completions of DISTINCT nodes racing against CONCURRENT reads: a background goroutine repeatedly calls both packages' Reconcilers AND Service.LoadLatest+Verify against the same, growing state_checkpoints table while writes are still landing. Every read either observes a consistent snapshot (zero violations, a Verify()-able latest checkpoint) or the frozen not-found error for 'no checkpoints yet' — asserted to never see a torn/inconsistent read across the whole run, then re-verified once more after wg.Wait() as a final, definitely-quiesced check."
  - "Proof 3 (two-reconciler-agreement): halts CompleteNode.Run via HaltAfter=PhaseVerifyArtifacts (evidence staged to disk, DB transaction never opened) after first completing 3 nodes cleanly, giving both Reconcilers real pre-existing history to reason about rather than an empty task. Constructs FRESH Reconciler struct values bound to the same *sqlite.DB/evidence dir after the halt (not reusing the harness's original struct values) to model a genuine process restart rather than the same long-lived object happening to still be around. internal/progress's Reconciler correctly finds exactly 1 orphaned staged artifact and 0 integrity violations; internal/statecheckpoint's Reconciler correctly reports CheckpointsScanned=3 (not 4 — the crash victim's row was never inserted) and 0 violations. Both conclusions describe the SAME crash window from two different vantage points (filesystem+artifacts table vs. state_checkpoints rows) without either reconciler knowing the other exists, and neither one falsely reports either a phantom 4th checkpoint or a broken pre-existing one. A subsequent retry with identical evidence content (proving FileStager's content-addressed idempotency) succeeds, and both reconcilers then re-converge to 0 orphans / 4 scanned / 0 violations, proving recovery is not merely non-contradictory but actually reaches a fully-reconciled end state."
  - "Genuine bug caught while building proof 3: the test's first draft used IDENTICAL literal Markdown content ('# X\\n\\nprose\\n') for every node's artifact, which meant every node's FileStager-staged evidence hashed to the SAME sha256 — the crash victim's own staged file was already 'referenced' by the 3 earlier checkpoints' manifests purely by content coincidence, so the orphan-detection assertion passed for the wrong reason (actually: failed with 0 orphans found, catching the flaw immediately). Fixed by a small uniqueMarkdown(nodeSuffix) helper giving every node's evidence genuinely distinct content/digest, which is exactly the kind of fixture-quality issue this role's own Wave 6 lessons-learned note (redact package's too-short Azure key fixture) already flagged as a recurring risk category worth calling out explicitly rather than silently patching."
  - "No cross-role contract gap found; no ports.go change requested. No production code in internal/progress or internal/statecheckpoint needed any change — every mechanism this node exercises (CompleteNode.Run, Service.Create/Snapshot/LoadLatest/Verify, both Reconcile methods) was already correct; this node's entire value is the proof, not a fix."

next_action: none — this was this role's LAST assigned DAG node (a01-a09, b01-b09 all complete)
assumptions:
  - "GENUINE SECURITY FINDING, not merely a test-writing exercise: while auditing every path-join in Part B for the adversarial fixtures this node's own DAG risk callout demands, found that Verify (verify.go) joined manifest.Artifacts[].Path directly onto row.ArtifactRoot with NO traversal/symlink validation at all — unlike validateUntrackedPath's identical treatment of git-reported untracked paths (security.go, checkpoint-b04). manifest.json is read fresh from disk on every Verify/RestoreDryRun call (RestoreDryRun's own checksum step calls Verify first) and is an ordinary file for as long as a checkpoint directory exists — nothing prevents it from later being hand-edited, corrupted, or restored from an untrusted source. Confirmed exploitable with a standalone reproduction BEFORE fixing it: a manifest with one artifact path rewritten to a '../'-laden relative path made Verify open, stat, and SHA-256 a file completely outside the checkpoint's own directory (its computed hash appeared in the mismatch report, proving the read happened). Fixed with a new safeArtifactPath guard (security.go) mirroring validateUntrackedPath's exact posture (no '..' segment, no absolute path, resolved path must stay under ArtifactRoot, neither the leaf nor any ancestor directory may be a symlink) applied to manifest-declared paths instead of git-reported ones. TestVerify_ManifestArtifactPathTraversal_Rejected (security_adversarial_test.go) is the permanent regression test, built by hand-tampering a REAL manifest.json produced by a REAL Capture call (not a synthetic fixture), and additionally asserts the secret file's actual content never leaks into the returned problem report."
  - "Two further defense-in-depth hardenings applied proactively (not confirmed independently exploitable through any current production caller, but closing the same class of gap before qa-06 or a future caller could reintroduce it): (1) writeArtifactDir (atomicwrite.go) now validates every files map key via a new safeRelativeName check before joining it under tempDir — today's only caller (capture.go) always supplies a small fixed set of literal names, but writeArtifactDir is this package's own general atomic-write primitive, not a Capture-only helper, so it should not rely on every future caller re-deriving the same safety property independently; (2) Capture itself (capture.go) now rejects a CheckpointID that is not a safe relative path segment before joining it onto ArtifactsRoot — CheckpointID is a public-API field, and while production wiring always supplies a domain.IDGenerator-produced opaque ID, this function's own contract does not otherwise prevent a caller from passing untrusted input. Both are unit-tested directly (security_adversarial_internal_test.go) AND proven not to break Capture's real files-map/CheckpointID usage (the full pre-existing suite stayed green with zero changes to any non-adversarial test)."
  - "Required-tests inventory reviewed against every earlier b02-b08 node before writing anything new (agents/checkpoint.md Part B's full list: tracked/staged/unstaged/untracked, rename/delete, binary file, spaces/newlines in path, nested worktree, concurrent mutation, temp cleanup, path traversal, oversize, secret-like file exclusion) — every one already has real coverage from b04-b08. This node's genuine increment, per its own DAG risk callout ('path traversal/symlink escape tests are a security gate'), is: (a) the manifest-path-traversal finding above; (b) a nested-directory-via-symlink escape (deeper than security_test.go's existing single top-level-symlink case) and a dangling-symlink case (target does not exist at all); (c) a malicious CheckpointID (both '../' and absolute-path shapes); (d) an embedded-NEWLINE-byte filename (a real, platform-permitted special-character shape distinct from the existing spaces-in-path test, proven to survive this package's NUL-terminated `-z` parsing); (e) a combined oversize-file-plus-symlink-escape single capture, proving the two independent guards both fire correctly together rather than one masking the other. Every fixture asserts the malicious path/content NEVER appears inside the produced archive/temp-directory tree, not merely that the call didn't error."
  - "Every adversarial fixture uses only argv-based gitx.Client calls (Constitution §7 rule 5) — the malicious inputs are filesystem-level (real symlinks via os.Symlink, a real hand-edited manifest.json, a crafted CheckpointID string) rather than attempted shell-command injection, since this whole codebase already never constructs a shell command string anywhere; the actual risk surface for this role is path-join safety, not command injection, which is exactly what this node's fixtures target."
  - "No cross-role contract gap found; no ports.go change requested. No schema/migration change — this node is pure Go-level hardening plus tests, entirely within internal/repocheckpoint (+ its own test files); internal/gitx was touched only by running its existing suite as a regression check, no gitx file was edited."
blockers: none
```

Final validation after both Wave 9 nodes together: `golangci-lint run ./...`
(whole repo) → 0 issues; `go build ./...` → OK; `go vet ./...` → OK;
`go test ./... -race` → green across every package, zero regressions. This
completes every DAG node ever assigned to the `checkpoint` role — Part A
(a01-a09) and Part B (b01-b09) are both fully complete; no further nodes
remain in this role's scope per `EXECUTION_DAG.md`.
