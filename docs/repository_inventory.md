## 1. Classification legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **authoritative** | The governing source of truth for its subject; conflicts resolve in its favor |
| **supporting** | Adds detail, execution mechanics, or scaffolding subordinate to an authoritative doc |
| **obsolete** | Superseded, contradicts current direction, or describes a prior product/plan |
| **duplicate** | Byte-identical or near-identical content that already exists canonically elsewhere |
| **archive** | Disposition (not a content type): keep for historical record, out of the active path |

## 3. Note on the `agent-packets/0X-*.md` files specifically

These are **not** pure clutter. The Day-1 plan itself (§3) instructs: *"If every worker must use Fable, do not give the complete 161 KB ADD to every worker. Give each worker only: this common plan; `CONTRACT_FREEZE.md`; its assigned ADD chapters; **its agent packet**."* — implying a standalone, per-agent file is the intended hand-off artifact so an isolated agent/worktree doesn't need the whole plan doc.

The problem is not their existence, it's that **two hand-maintained copies of the same text now exist** (the embedded section in the plan doc, and the standalone file), with no mechanism keeping them in sync. That is a drift risk, not a one-time redundancy.

`agent-packets/README.md` is different: it duplicates the entire plan body under a misleading filename and serves no distinct purpose — it is a straightforward duplicate with no operational role.

---

## 4. Referenced but missing (not yet created — flagged for awareness, not classified above)

These are named by the ADD and/or Day-1 plan as required but do not exist anywhere in the repository:

`AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/adr/**`, `docs/implementation/day1/CONTRACT_FREEZE.md`, `docs/implementation/day1/A00.md`…`A08.md`, `docs/providers/claude/**`, `docs/security/**`.

The repository also has no `.git` directory (not yet an initialized Git repository), which is a prerequisite the Day-1 plan assumes (worktrees, branches, commits).

---

## 5. Proposed Migration Plan (NOT executed — awaiting approval)

Ordered by risk, lowest first. Every step preserves history (archive/move, not delete) unless explicitly marked otherwise.

1. **Create `docs/archive/` and move the two obsolete files there, unmodified.**
   - `AgentGuard_Architecture.md` → `docs/archive/AgentGuard_Architecture.md`
   - `execution_prompt.md` → `docs/archive/execution_prompt.md`
   - Rationale: both are superseded by `Preflight_ADD.md` / `Preflight_Day1_Parallel_Execution_Plan.md`; archiving (not deleting) preserves the design history and avoids losing the earlier reasoning.

2. **Remove `agent-packets/README.md`.**
   - It is a pure duplicate of `Preflight_Day1_Parallel_Execution_Plan.md` (sections 1–13) with no distinct purpose and is not linked from anywhere.
   - Replace with a short, real README (a few lines) that: (a) states these files are per-agent hand-off packets extracted from `Preflight_Day1_Parallel_Execution_Plan.md`, (b) links back to that file as canonical, (c) lists the 9 packet filenames and their agent IDs.

3. **Resolve the `agent-packets/0X-*.md` duplication with a single source of truth.**
   - Two options, both reasonable — this needs your decision, not mine:
     - **Option A (recommended):** Keep `agent-packets/0X-*.md` as the canonical, hand-off-ready files (they're already used that way per Day-1 plan §3). Replace the embedded "Agent Packets" section in `Preflight_Day1_Parallel_Execution_Plan.md` with short summaries plus a link to each `agent-packets/0X-*.md` file, so there is one place to edit each packet.
     - **Option B:** Keep the plan doc as the single canonical file (current behavior) and regenerate `agent-packets/0X-*.md` from it mechanically (e.g., a small script/Makefile target) instead of hand-maintaining both.
   - Until this is decided, no packet content should be edited in only one location.

4. **Relocate the contract-freeze template.**
   - Move `agent-packets/CONTRACT_FREEZE_TEMPLATE.md` → `docs/implementation/day1/CONTRACT_FREEZE_TEMPLATE.md` (or leave in place and have A00 copy it to `docs/implementation/day1/CONTRACT_FREEZE.md` when contract freeze actually runs). Either is fine; flagging so it isn't forgotten once `docs/implementation/day1/` is scaffolded.

5. **Scaffold the missing files the ADD/Day-1 plan assume exist** (§4 above), at minimum: `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/implementation/day1/`. This is listed for completeness; it is new-file creation, not migration of existing content, and may belong to a later phase rather than this normalization pass.

### Explicitly not proposed

- No deletion of any file's content — only moves/archival and one true duplicate removal (`agent-packets/README.md`), and even that is reproducible from git history... except **this is not yet a Git repository**, so deletion of `agent-packets/README.md` would be unrecoverable by version control. Recommend initializing Git before executing step 2, or moving it to `docs/archive/` instead of deleting it, to stay safe.
- No edits to `Preflight_ADD.md` (A00-exclusive per its own rules).
- No edits to file content/wording anywhere — this plan is moves/removals only.

## 6. Execution log (2026-07-12) — normalization approved and applied

The plan in §5 was approved and executed, with §5-step-3 resolved as **Option A**
(the recommended one). No Go code was touched; no teammates were created.

| Action | Result |
|---|---|
| `AgentGuard_Architecture.md` moved to `docs/archive/` | Done — file unmodified except a short "ARCHIVED — obsolete" notice prepended above its original title |
| `execution_prompt.md` moved to `docs/archive/` | Done — file unmodified except a short "ARCHIVED — obsolete" notice prepended above its original text |
| `agent-packets/README.md` rewritten | Done — no longer a duplicate of the plan; now a real, scoped README for the `agent-packets/` directory that names `agent-packets/0X-*.md` as canonical |
| `Preflight_Day1_Parallel_Execution_Plan.md` "Agent Packets" section (lines 366–1093) | Replaced with a short index table linking to `agent-packets/0X-*.md`. Those standalone files are now the **single source of truth** for packet content; the plan doc only summarizes and links. Sections 1–13 (lines 1–365) were left byte-for-byte unchanged. |
| `agent-packets/CONTRACT_FREEZE_TEMPLATE.md` | Left in place (not relocated) — still the correct staging location until A00 actually produces `docs/implementation/day1/CONTRACT_FREEZE.md`; `agent-packets/README.md` now documents its purpose |
| Root `README.md` | Created (did not exist before). Points to `Preflight_ADD.md` as sole architecture authority, links every other governing doc, states real project status (pre-M0). |
| Root `AGENTS.md` | Created (did not exist before), verbatim from `Preflight_ADD.md` Appendix G ("Initial AGENTS.md") — the ADD's own prescribed content, not invented text. |
| `docs/implementation/day1/`, `docs/adr/`, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` | **Not created.** Out of scope for this normalization pass (no existing content to migrate); still flagged as gaps in §4 above. Belongs to milestone M0, not repository normalization. |
| Git repository | **Still not initialized.** Recommend `git init` + first commit before further changes, so future moves/deletes are recoverable through version control rather than relying on manual archival. |

### Resulting state: exactly one source of truth per subject

| Subject | Single source of truth |
|---|---|
| Architecture | `Preflight_ADD.md` |
| Day-1 execution mechanics | `Preflight_Day1_Parallel_Execution_Plan.md` |
| Per-agent packet content | `agent-packets/0X-*.md` |
| Contributor/agent instructions | `AGENTS.md` |
| Project overview/entry point | `README.md` |
| Repository markdown audit | this file |
| Superseded/obsolete material | `docs/archive/` (kept, not deleted, not authoritative) |

No two markdown files in the repository now contain overlapping authoritative content.
