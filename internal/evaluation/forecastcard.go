// forecastcard.go: the issue-#14 per-prompt forecast surface's data +
// presenter layer, owned by this package because this package owns the
// persisted data it renders (predictions/policy_decisions, migrations
// 0041/0043). ForecastCard and the Service methods producing it are
// exported PACKAGE API, deliberately NOT part of the frozen
// app.EvaluationService contract (internal/app/ports.go is frozen; ADR-043
// requires contract impact to stay additive) — consumers that want a card
// depend on the concrete *evaluation.Service (or a caller-local narrow
// interface over these two methods, e.g. internal/orchestrator's
// ForecastCardSource), exactly the same only-the-real-service pattern
// IssueAuthorization already established for `decision allow`.
//
// # Read-back, not recompute
//
// The card is built by reading back the prediction + policy-decision rows
// EvaluateTurn already persisted (FR-172), not by re-running the pipeline
// or holding pipeline outputs in memory across calls. This is the honest
// minimal path issue #14 asks for: EvaluateTurn's frozen return DTO
// (app.Evaluation) has no room for scope/token/risk/action fields and must
// not be widened, the rows are written atomically in the same transaction
// as the evaluation itself, and a read-back presenter works identically
// for the three surfaces that need it — the UserPromptSubmit hook (card
// for the evaluation it just ran), the statusline (latest card for a
// session), and `auspex evaluate`.
//
// # Constitution principle #2 (uncalibrated score is never a probability)
//
// Every rendered surface labels the card "uncalibrated estimate" while
// Calibrated is false, and ForecastCard.Probability is nil (JSON null)
// unless a calibrated probability actually exists — which, this phase, it
// never does: neither migration 0041 nor 0043 persists one, so the field
// is structurally always nil until a calibration phase lands and persists
// it. That is the "cold-start emits probability: null" rule made
// load-bearing in the type, not just in prose.
