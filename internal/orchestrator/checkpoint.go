// (ErrCodeUnavailable) if either is nil, rather than silently skipping a
// checkpoint stage.

// CheckpointCreate implements agents/runtime.md Part B pipeline step 9:
// "`checkpoint create` calls Part A of the checkpoint role (state), then
// its Part B (repository), per the frozen transaction/orchestration
// contract."
//
// # Ordering is the whole point of this node (High risk per the DAG)
//
// State MUST be created before Repository, and MUST succeed before
// Repository is even attempted — never the reverse, and never both
// unconditionally. This mirrors CONTRACT_FREEZE.md's "Transaction
// boundaries" section on GracefulPauseService's persist phase: "a
// sequence of dependent writes... each step's own transaction boundary is
// defined by that step's owning service; runtime is responsible for
// sequencing them and handling partial-sequence failure as a resumable
// state, not a silent gap." The concrete failure mode this ordering
// prevents: if Repository were created first (or unconditionally) and
// State then failed, Preflight would be left with a Repository Checkpoint
// that has no corresponding State Checkpoint recording what task/node it
// belongs to — an orphaned repository checkpoint, exactly what this
// node's task brief calls out by name. By calling State first and
// returning immediately on its error, CheckpointCreate makes that
// orphaned-repository-checkpoint outcome structurally unreachable: the
// code path that would create a Repository Checkpoint is never even
// entered unless State already succeeded.
//
// A State Checkpoint failure is therefore fail-closed per
// CONTRACT_FREEZE.md's error contract ("State Checkpoint requested but
// failed -> fail closed", ADD §17.5): CheckpointCreate returns the
// State error as-is, with no Repository call attempted at all, and
// CheckpointCreateResult is not returned (zero value) — there is no
// partial-success shape for this operation's return value, only whole
// success or a propagated error naming which stage failed.
