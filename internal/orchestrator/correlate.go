// correlate.go implements the event-correlation half of the "explicit
// completion + event correlation" design that closes qa's P1 finding
// (docs/implementation/vertical-slice/qa.md §Severity-ranked findings;
// GitHub issue #1): before this file, no producer anywhere assigned
// pkg/protocol/v1.Event.TaskID or Event.ProgressNodeID — every event the
// hook handlers persisted carried only a SessionID, so no consumer could
// ever connect a persisted provider observation back to the Progress Tree
// node it was evidence about.
//
// EventCorrelator fills those two already-frozen fields (they have existed
// on v1.Event since the contract freeze; nothing in pkg/protocol/v1
// changes here) at hook-persist time, and ONLY when the answer is
// unambiguous:
//
//   - TaskID comes from the frozen app.FeatureDataSource.Resolve port
//     (ADR-044 / REC-01, internal/app/ports.go — frozen 2026-07-13), the
//     same session -> repository/task lookup the evaluation pipeline
//     already uses. Resolve returning a nil TaskID is cold-start, not an
//     error (per that port's own doc comment), and leaves the field empty.
//   - ProgressNodeID comes from the task's Progress Tree snapshot
//     (app.ProgressTreeService.Snapshot), and is populated ONLY when
//     exactly one node is currently in_progress. Zero in-progress nodes
//     means there is nothing to attribute the observation to; more than
//     one means attribution would be a guess between candidates — and the
//     Constitution's "unknown is not zero" principle (ADD principle 1,
//     CONTRACT_FREEZE.md) forbids fabricating a correlation that was not
//     actually observed. Both cases leave the field empty.
//
// Correlation is deliberately best-effort and fail-open, matching the hook
// handlers' own discipline (hooks.go: "a hook must never fail the user's
// actual prompt/turn because Preflight's own event log could not be
// written", ADD §17.5): any resolver/snapshot error simply persists the
// event uncorrelated. An uncorrelated event is strictly less useful, never
// wrong; a hook aborted by a correlation lookup would be provider-visible
// breakage.
//
// Note what this file deliberately does NOT do: it never calls
// app.ProgressTreeService.CompleteNode. Correlation annotates persisted
// evidence; actually completing a node remains an explicit, evidence-
// carrying operation (`preflight progress complete`, internal/cli/
// progress.go) per the approved issue #1 design — Constitution §6.2's "a
// node may not become completed without durable, validator-checked
// artifact evidence" rules out treating a bare Stop signal as completion
// evidence by itself.
