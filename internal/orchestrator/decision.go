// decision.go implements `auspex decision allow` / `auspex decision
// deny` (agents/runtime.md Part B P0 command list; EXECUTION_DAG.md
// runtime-b06) — the two remaining decision-flow commands after
// runtime-b03's Evaluate pipeline. Per the task brief, this node's explicit
// job is to wire the REAL internal/evaluation.Service (predictor-09/10,
// both integrated on main as of this phase) into the decision-allow path,
// replacing runtime-b03's FAKE app.EvaluationService — this is now a HARD
// dependency, not fake-able, per the DAG's own note: "second-authorization-
// replay-rejected is a required test," and a fake can only ever simulate
// that guarantee, never actually prove it holds against real, storage-
// backed exactly-once consumption.
//
// # The two-call flow this file implements
//
// agents/runtime.md Part B pipeline step 10 ("`decision allow` issues
// one-time authorization") and step 11 ("Resubmitted prompt consumes
// authorization exactly once before allowing") describe two DIFFERENT
// moments of the same flow, not one call:
//
//  1. First call (no AuthorizationID supplied): the evaluation already
//     computed a decision (via runtime-b03's Evaluate, upstream of this
//     command) that required confirmation/checkpoint before proceeding.
//     DecisionAllowCmd issues a fresh one-time app.Authorization bound to
//     this turn/prompt, and returns it WITHOUT yet allowing anything to
//     proceed — the caller must resubmit.
//  2. Second call (AuthorizationID supplied — the resubmission):
//     DecisionAllowCmd instead calls the real
//     app.EvaluationService.ConsumeAuthorization with that ID. Success
//     means this resubmission is allowed to proceed exactly once; a THIRD
//     call reusing the same AuthorizationID (the replay case) is rejected
//     by the same real, storage-backed exactly-once check predictor-10
//     hardened — proven end-to-end through this orchestrator layer, not
//     merely simulated by a fake.
//
// This mirrors pauselifecycle.go's Resume/Cancel split (two related but
// distinct actions behind one small file) and evaluate.go's own
// fail-open/fail-closed discipline: EvaluateTurn/Decide/ConsumeAuthorization/
// IssueAuthorization failures are this command's actual purpose, so they
// propagate as-is (fail-closed) — there is no operational-observation gap
// to fail open over here, unlike Evaluate's optional Progress
// Tree/observation/Git-snapshot steps.
