//     posture): the user explicitly asked Auspex to run this prompt, and

//     typed error is returned and the provider binary is never started —
//     the managed mode's whole enforcement advantage over native hooks
//     (ADD §8.1 vs §8.3).
//   - A spawn failure fails CLOSED (typed error) after best-effort
//     persisting a provider.turn.failed event, so the already-persisted
//     turn.started is not left dangling without a terminal event.
//   - A provider process that starts and exits — with ANY exit code — is
//     NOT a Run error (internal/gitx.ExecRunner's exact contract): the
//     exit code is attribution data, persisted and reported, and the
//     CLI's exit status stays "the managed run itself succeeded".
//   - Telemetry persistence failures fail OPEN into a lower
//     EventsPersisted count, per the hook path's persist discipline.
