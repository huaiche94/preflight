// stream.go: defensive line-by-line parsing of Claude Code's `--output-
// format stream-json` output (ADD §22.1 supported path 3). The parsing
// posture mirrors internal/providers/claude/statusline.go's fail-open
// discipline exactly, for the same reason issue #27 documented there: one
// unrecognized line — a new event type the provider adds, a malformed
// line, a line too large to be interesting — must degrade to a skip
// count, never take the whole run's telemetry down. The runner's job is
// to keep the user's provider turn moving and attribute its outcome; a
// parse gap is a counted, visible degradation, not a crash.
//
// Only the `result` line's fields are modeled (that is where the MVP's
// outcome attribution lives — total_cost_usd/duration_ms/num_turns/
// is_error plus the per-turn `usage` token block, ADD §8.7 "exact
// completed usage"), with ONE addition: the system `init` line's `model`
// field, so the run's token sample can be cohort-labeled without
// guessing (issue #11). Assistant lines also carry a per-message `usage`
// object, but it is deliberately NOT read: the recorded probe fixture
// (testdata/stream_recorded_hi.jsonl) shows assistant lines reporting
// output_tokens=2 mid-stream while the terminal result line reported 157
// for the very same message id — a streaming-progress snapshot, not a
// final figure. The result line's `usage` block is the provider CLI's
// own completed accounting of the whole run (it even carries an
// `iterations` breakdown when the run made several API calls), and one
// managed run IS one turn, so the result line's totals are THE turn's
// usage. Per-message live usage modeling is issue #8's continuous-runway
// increment, not this one (see doc.go).
//
// # Privacy (Constitution §7 rule 2)
//
// The result line's `result` text and the assistant messages' content are
// NEVER retained on any returned struct — StreamResult keeps only the
// result text's byte length, the same length-only discipline
// internal/hooks/claude applies to provider error messages. The raw lines
// are relayed verbatim to the caller-supplied writer (the user's own
// terminal — display, not retention) and then dropped.
