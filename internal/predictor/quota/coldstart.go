package quota

// defaultQuotaDeltaP50/P90 are the cold-start "typical turn" quota
// percentage-point delta, used when no empirical per-provider/model/task-
// class delta distribution exists yet (ADD §15.3 step 5, "依
// provider/model/task class 計算 empirical P50/P90" — unreachable this
// wave with no durable telemetry store, per this package's doc comment).
//
// ADD §15.3 does not name an exact default delta value (unlike §14.6's
// token-multiplier table), so these are this package's own conservative,
// documented bootstrap constants: a "typical" turn is assumed to consume
// roughly 2 percentage points of a rolling quota window at P50, with a
// P90 tail of 6 points (3x) to reflect that some turns burn substantially
// more (long tool-call chains, retries, large context re-reads) without
// assuming a fixed token ceiling (ADD §15.3's explicit "不得假設固定
// token ceiling"). These are starting points, not measured values, and
// are expected to be replaced by StatisticalQuotaForecaster's empirical
// quantiles (Auspex_Predictor_Design_Supplement.md's Version 2) once
// durable per-window delta samples exist.

// internal/predictor/token's per-multiplier capping discipline (ADD

// calibrate" — unreachable this wave for the same reason as the quota
// defaults above). D-14: these were originally window-capacity fractions
// (0.03/0.10) tuned when 200k was the only window size — on a 1M window
// "10% per turn" meant an absurd 100k tokens and the projection ran a
// full order of magnitude hot (the owner's first-night dogfooding
// caught it). The token values below are the SAME absolute growth those
// fractions meant on a 200k window, so 200k behavior is unchanged and
// larger windows scale honestly. Context growth is normally smaller than
// total tokens processed since provider cache/compaction reduces net
// growth (ADD §15.9); these bootstrap values stay deliberately
// conservative so a first cold-start estimate does not understate risk.
