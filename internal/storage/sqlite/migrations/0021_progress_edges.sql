-- 0021_progress_edges.sql
--
-- Preflight_ADD.md §12.2 canonical schema: `progress_edges` — explicit
-- dependency/relationship edges between Progress Tree nodes, beyond the
-- parent/child shape already carried by progress_nodes.parent_id
-- (checkpoint Part A range 0020-0029 per CONTRACT_FREEZE.md), transcribed
-- column-for-column from §12.2.
--
-- The composite PRIMARY KEY makes an edge naturally idempotent to
-- re-insert-with-conflict semantics: the same (task, from, to, kind) edge
-- cannot exist twice, so a duplicate plan upsert is a constraint violation
-- for the service layer to treat as "already present," never a silent
-- second row.
--
-- edge_kind is a plain TEXT discriminator (e.g. dependency policy classes
-- per ADD §6.4); like progress_nodes.status it is deliberately not a CHECK
-- constraint — released migrations are immutable (ADD §12.5), so the edge
-- vocabulary belongs to the Progress Tree service (checkpoint-a02), not
-- DDL.
