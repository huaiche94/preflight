// resumevalidation.go: runtime-a08 — agents/runtime.md Part A deliverable 8,
// "Resume validation: quota safe; repository fingerprint compatible;
// session/provider capability valid; authorization/consent valid." This is
// the real check lifecycle.go's package comment names as its own explicitly
// documented gap: Resume (lifecycle.go, runtime-b07) drives the state
// machine from a CALLER-SUPPLIED verdict (ResumeRequest.Valid/QuotaUnsafe/
// Conflict); this file COMPUTES that verdict for real, so a caller (a
// future Part B wiring node) can pass ValidateResume's ResumeValidationResult
// straight into ResumeRequest instead of inventing its own answer.
//
// # Why four separate checkers, not one function
//
// Each of the four checks agents/runtime.md names is independently
// swappable and independently faked in tests (mirrors safepoint.go's
// CheckpointPersister/Interrupter split and persistphase.go's PersistDeps
// bundle): quota safety needs a live quota reader, repository compatibility
// needs both the frozen app.RepositoryCheckpointService.Verify AND a
// current-repo-state reader, session capability needs a provider-session
// reader, and authorization needs the frozen
// app.EvaluationService.ConsumeAuthorization. Bundling all four behind one
// interface would force every caller (including every test) to implement
// all four even when only one is under test — exactly the "God interface"
// Constitution §4 and agents/contract-integrator.md warn against.
//
// # Fail-closed discipline (DAG risk note: "the last line before
// # unattended code execution")
//
// Every checker returns (CheckResult, error), and the two failure channels
// mean two different things, deliberately:
//
//   - A downstream READ failure (the quota/repository/session/authorization
//     service itself errors when asked) is reported as a FAILING CheckResult
//     with an "_UNAVAILABLE"-suffixed reason code (e.g.
//     ReasonQuotaReadUnavailable), not a Go error. This is still fail-closed
//     — the check does not pass — but it flows through the same channel a
//     normal rejection does, so a caller building a full audit trail (e.g. a
//     resume_attempts row) can record WHY resume did not proceed, and a
//     human resolving a BlockedConflict via ADD §20.9's UI sees "session
//     capability unavailable" as a concrete reason, not a crash. This
//     mirrors CONTRACT_FREEZE.md's own error contract shape (a distinct
//     reason code, not a bare panic) applied at the validation-gate layer.
//   - A returned Go error is reserved for a COMPOSITION bug: a nil
//     dependency, or a malformed request (missing SessionID, etc.) — the
//     caller wired this wrong, as opposed to "the check ran and found a
//     problem." ValidateResume stops immediately on this class of error
//     without running any further checks, because a mis-wired caller's
//     later checks would be running against an already-invalid setup, not
//     because a downstream read failure aborts anything.
//
// Both channels are equally fail-closed in the sense that neither is ever
// silently treated as a pass (per the DAG's "the last line before
// unattended code execution" framing) — they are simply reported through
// the shape ("this is data for the audit trail" vs. "this is a bug to
// fix") that best matches which kind of failure occurred.
//
// # Order of checks
//
// Quota first (cheapest, most common failure — reschedule is a normal,
// expected outcome, not a conflict), then repository, then session
// capability, then authorization (the most expensive / most consequential
// check, since a consumed authorization cannot be un-consumed). This
// mirrors persistphase.go's own "cheapest/most-idempotent-safe first"
// ordering discipline: an early quota-unsafe result must not spend a
// one-time Authorization on a resume attempt that is about to be
// rescheduled anyway.

// --- Wake job rescheduling on quota-unsafe --------------------------------

// WakeJobRescheduler is the narrow slice of scheduler.Store's real API
// RescheduleWakeJobOnQuotaUnsafe needs. Declared here (not a direct
// *scheduler.Store parameter) purely so this file's own tests can use a
// lightweight fake instead of standing up a real SQLite-backed
// scheduler.Store for a unit test that only cares about the reschedule
// DECISION, not scheduler.Store's own storage correctness (already proven
// by runtime-a06/a07's lease_test.go/restart_test.go) — production callers
// pass a real *scheduler.Store, which satisfies this interface directly.
type WakeJobRescheduler interface {
	Fail(ctx context.Context, id domain.WakeJobID, owner string, failureReason string) (scheduler.Job, error)
}

// RescheduleWakeJobOnQuotaUnsafe implements the required test "unsafe
// quota reschedules" at the scheduler-integration level (as opposed to
// ResumeValidationResult.Verdict, which only proves the PAUSE RECORD's own
// state-machine transition targets Sleeping): when ValidateResume's quota
// check is the (sole) reason a resume did not proceed, the underlying wake
// job must actually be given a new run_after via the scheduler's own ADD
// §20.7 retry/backoff schedule — otherwise a pause record could sit in
// Sleeping forever with its wake job stuck in a terminal or stale-leased
// state, never actually waking the session back up for a later attempt.
// This deliberately reuses scheduler.Store.Fail (runtime-a06) rather than
// inventing a second reschedule mechanism: a quota-unsafe resume attempt
// IS a failed attempt from the wake job's own perspective, and Fail's
// existing backoff-then-retry-or-dead semantics are exactly ADD §20.7's
// intended behavior for "try again later, give up after MaxAttempts."
//
// The caller must currently hold jobID's lease (owner) — this is the same
// precondition scheduler.Store.Fail itself requires (ErrCodeConflict
// otherwise) — which in practice means this is called from within the
// scheduler-driven wake pipeline (a09's own claim-then-drive loop), not
// from an arbitrary manual `preflight resume` invocation that never
// claimed a lease in the first place; a manual resume's quota-unsafe
// verdict is still correctly reflected on the PAUSE RECORD via
// Resume/Verdict regardless of whether a wake job reschedule applies.
