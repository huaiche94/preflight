// CheckpointPersister is the narrow seam PersistThenInterrupt uses for

// intentionally as narrow as this node needs — just "persist something
// and report whether it succeeded" — because the DAG explicitly scopes
// runtime-a04 to "no concrete store required to begin" and directs using
// fakes for checkpoint's services (mirroring runtime-b05's
// CheckpointCreateDeps pattern in internal/orchestrator/checkpoint.go,
// which fakes app.StateCheckpointService/app.RepositoryCheckpointService
// the same way). The full multi-step Phase-3 persist orchestration
// (Progress Tree snapshot, State Checkpoint, Repository Checkpoint, Pause
// Record, Wake Job — CONTRACT_FREEZE.md's "GracefulPauseService's persist
// phase") is runtime-a05's node, not this one; this seam is deliberately
// just enough to prove the ordering guarantee this node's required test
// asks for.

// Interrupter is the narrow seam PersistThenInterrupt uses for "signal the

// frozen app.TurnInterrupter (which needs a full RunLocator); this node
// only needs to prove ordering, and a later node wires the real
// app.TurnInterrupter behind an adapter satisfying this interface.

// persists checkpoints before interrupt" (agents/runtime.md required
// test): given a reported safe-point observation, checkpoint persistence
// via persister.Persist MUST be called and MUST succeed before
// interrupter.Interrupt is ever invoked — never the reverse, and never
// both unconditionally. This mirrors runtime-b05's
// internal/orchestrator.CheckpointCreate ordering pattern exactly (state
// before repository, early-return on the first error), applied one layer
// up at the safe-point boundary instead of the checkpoint-role boundary.
//
// If obs is not a safe boundary at all, PersistThenInterrupt returns a
// validation error and calls neither collaborator — this function is not
// itself responsible for WAITING for a safe point (that is the quiescing
// phase's timeout/poll loop, a later concern), only for enforcing the
// ordering once a boundary is reported.
