// interrupt.go: InterruptAndSleep — runtime-a11's closure of a genuine gap
// this comprehensive-integration node found, not a re-test of existing
// behavior. agents/runtime.md's required test "provider interrupt failure
// leaves recoverable state" already had a transition-table edge
// (statemachine.go: {Interrupting, interrupt_failed} -> Failed, proven at
// the bare Apply level by TestStateTransition_ProviderInterruptFailureLeavesRecoverableState)
// and a fake to drive it (runtime-a10's FakeTurnInterrupter), but no
// production code anywhere in this package actually CALLS a
// TurnInterrupter and applies EventProviderStopped/EventInterruptFailed to
// a real PauseRecord based on the outcome. safepoint.go's
// PersistThenInterrupt (runtime-a04) deliberately stops short of this: it
// proves persist-before-interrupt ORDERING only, via its own narrow
// Interrupter seam, and never touches PauseStore/Apply at all (see its own
// doc comment — that was runtime-a04's explicit, documented scope
// boundary, not an oversight). Nothing built since has closed the
// remaining gap: driving Interrupting -> {Sleeping | Failed} against a
// real, durable PauseRecord.
//
// InterruptAndSleep closes exactly that gap: given a record already at
// domain.PauseInterrupting (i.e. Persist has already completed — the real
// production sequencing this function assumes, not re-validates), it
// calls the real app.TurnInterrupter, then applies EventProviderStopped
// (-> Sleeping) on success or EventInterruptFailed (-> Failed) on error,
// via the same CompareAndSwapStatus discipline lifecycle.go/wake.go use —
// so a concurrent Cancel racing this call is handled identically (Cancel
// wins if it lands first; Interrupting has no Cancel edge per
// statemachine.go, so once this function's own CAS attempt is in flight
// there is nothing left to race, matching ADD §20.11's documented
// narrowing of the cancel-race window to "before Resuming actually
// starts", not "before every phase").
