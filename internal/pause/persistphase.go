// persistphase.go: the Phase-3 persist orchestrator (agents/runtime.md
// Part A deliverable 5 / EXECUTION_DAG.md runtime-a05 — "Second highest-risk
// task in the whole DAG": "orchestrates five durable writes across
// `checkpoint` Part A and Part B stores inside one logical operation."
//
// CONTRACT_FREEZE.md's "Transaction boundaries" section is the frozen
// authority this file implements against, verbatim:
//
//	"GracefulPauseService's persist phase (Progress Tree snapshot -> State
//	Checkpoint -> Repository Checkpoint -> Pause Record -> Wake Job) is a
//	sequence of dependent writes, not one flat transaction (it spans the
//	checkpoint role's two parts) -- each step's own transaction boundary is
//	defined by that step's owning service; runtime is responsible for
//	sequencing them and handling partial-sequence failure as a resumable
//	state, not a silent gap."
//
// That sentence is this file's entire design brief. There is deliberately
// NO internal/app.TxRunner.WithTx wrapping all five steps — Progress Tree,
// State Checkpoint, and Repository Checkpoint are each a different owning
// service with its own atomic boundary already (checkpoint-a04's
// CompleteNode transaction, checkpoint-a05's manifest write,
// checkpoint-b04's capture+insert); wrapping a SECOND, wider transaction
// around three independent services' own commits is not just unnecessary,
// it is impossible without a distributed-transaction protocol this project
// does not have. So PersistPhase's job is exactly what CONTRACT_FREEZE.md
// says: sequence five independently-durable steps in a fixed order, and
// make a crash after ANY one of them resumable without loss or
// duplication.
//
// # Why this mirrors runtime-a04's safepoint.go and runtime-b05's
// # orchestrator.CheckpointCreate exactly
//
// Both existing precedents establish the same shape this file scales up to
// five steps: validate all dependencies up front (fail closed, never a nil
// pointer panic later), call step N, return immediately on step N's error
// without attempting step N+1 (so a partial sequence is always "the first
// K steps genuinely succeeded, then stopped" — never "some later step ran
// despite an earlier one failing"). PersistPhase adds exactly one new
// concept beyond that: since there are five dependent steps instead of two,
// and a real process crash (not just a returned error) can occur BETWEEN
// two steps that each individually already committed durably, this file
// also needs a durable, restart-safe record of "how far did the last
// attempt get" -- that is PhaseProgress (recorded on PauseRecord, this
// package's own store) plus per-step idempotent-skip logic (Resume,
// below). HaltAfter/HaltError below is the literal crash-injection
// technique named in the task brief, transplanted from
// internal/progress/complete_node.go's own Phase/HaltError pattern
// (checkpoint-a04's precedent) rather than reinvented.
//
// # Idempotent-skip, not a second transaction
//
// Each of the five steps is independently idempotent-safe to retry (this is
// what makes "crash after every phase resumes/reconciles correctly"
// provable without a distributed transaction):
//
//  1. Progress Tree snapshot: a pure read (app.ProgressTreeService.Snapshot)
//     -- re-running it after a crash is always safe, it has no side effect
//     to duplicate. Recorded on the PauseRecord only so callers/diagnostics
//     can see a snapshot was taken; PersistPhase does not gate later steps
//     on this value's content, only on whether the call itself succeeded.
//  2. State Checkpoint: PersistPhase checks
//     PauseRecord.StateCheckpointID first -- if already set (a prior
//     attempt's Create already committed before the crash), it is NOT
//     called again; the existing ID is reused. This is the same "idempotent
//     by skip" discipline CONTRACT_FREEZE.md's CompleteNodeRequest section
//     describes at the checkpoint layer, applied here at the orchestration
//     layer since app.StateCheckpointService.Create itself has no
//     caller-supplied idempotency key in its frozen request shape
//     (CreateStateCheckpointRequest has only a TaskID).
//  3. Repository Checkpoint: identical skip-if-already-recorded logic,
//     keyed on PauseRecord.RepositoryCheckpointID.
//  4. Pause Record: this package's own store -- Upsert is naturally
//     idempotent, since it is a single durable UPDATE of one row's phase
//     markers (see PauseStore.UpdatePersistProgress below), not an insert
//     that could duplicate.
//  5. Wake Job: internal/scheduler.Store.Schedule already enforces
//     UNIQUE(pause_id, job_kind) -- a retried Schedule call after a crash
//     that already committed the row hits that constraint and returns
//     ErrCodeConflict, which PersistPhase treats as "already scheduled,
//     fetch the existing job" rather than a real failure (this is the
//     schema-level exactly-once anchor runtime-a06's own doc comment
//     names, reused here rather than reimplemented).
