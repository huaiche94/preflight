// service.go: Service — the real, concrete app.GracefulPauseService
// implementation the Final integration gate review found missing (a
// lead-identified finding routed to this role, not a numbered DAG node; see
// docs/implementation/day1/runtime.md's corrective-addition section for the
// full writeup).
//
// # Why this file exists
//
// Every individual piece of Part A's real business logic already existed,
// already tested, across runtime-a02 through a11: the transition validator
// (statemachine.go), Observe's debounce/hysteresis (observe.go),
// RequestPause's idempotency (requestpause.go), the safe-point-triggered
// persist-then-interrupt ordering (safepoint.go), the five-phase persist
// orchestrator (persistphase.go), InterruptAndSleep (interrupt.go), Wake
// (wake.go), Cancel/Resume (lifecycle.go), and ValidateResume
// (resumevalidation.go). But `grep -rn "var _ app.GracefulPauseService"`
// across the whole repo, before this file, found only
// internal/testutil/fakes.FakeGracefulPauseService (a test double) — no
// concrete production type ever composed these pieces into the frozen
// six-method app.GracefulPauseService shape. That is why
// cmd/auspex/main.go was never wired to a real pause service: the root
// composition cannot instantiate a port that has no real implementation.
//
// This file is pure composition and DTO-shape translation, per the task
// brief: no state transition, debounce rule, persist-phase step, or
// validation check is reimplemented here — Service's six methods each
// delegate directly to the already-tested function/type that already does
// the real work, translating between the frozen app.* DTOs and this
// package's own richer internal shapes (PauseRecord, RequestPauseRequest,
// ResumeValidationRequest, etc.) exactly as requestpause.go's own doc
// comment already anticipated ("a later node is responsible for mapping
// between the two at the GracefulPauseService boundary, not this one").
//
// # Two genuine, explicitly-surfaced DTO-shape gaps (Constitution §7 rule 3)
//
// Composing against the frozen shapes surfaced two real gaps that no
// previous node could have found, because no previous node ever had to
// satisfy the full six-method interface at once:
//
//  1. app.PauseRequest is exactly {SessionID, Reason} — it carries no
//     TaskID, WorktreeID, or TriggerReason. This package's own PauseKey
//     (requestpause.go) requires BOTH TaskID and SessionID, and Persist
//     (persistphase.go) additionally requires a WorktreeID. A repo-wide
//     search (confirmed against internal/app/ports.go in full, every
//     orchestrator.PauseRequestCmd call site, and the tasks/provider_sessions
//     migration schema) found no frozen port anywhere that resolves a
//     SessionID to its active TaskID/WorktreeID — internal/cli/pause.go's
//     own doc comment independently confirms this same gap ("no resolver
//     port exists yet") for its own, differently-shaped CLI flags. This is
//     a real, load-bearing capability gap, not an oversight of this file:
//     the frozen contract's Observe/RequestPause boundary was designed
//     around a SessionID-keyed caller, but this package's durable state is
//     keyed on (TaskID, SessionID) plus a WorktreeID for repository
//     checkpointing. SessionContextResolver below is this file's own
//     narrow, explicitly-named seam for that gap — mirrors
//     resumevalidation.go's QuotaSnapshotReader/RepoFingerprintReader/
//     SessionCapabilityReader precedent exactly: a small interface this
//     package depends on but does not implement, left for whichever future
//     wiring node has access to the real tasks/provider_sessions tables
//     (this role's exclusive paths do not include those tables' owning
//     stores).
//  2. Persist's PersistPauseStore (GetProgress/SaveProgress) was never
//     reconciled onto SQLiteStore — persistphase_test.go's own
//     seedPauseRecordRow doc comment names this exact gap explicitly
//     ("a future integration node reconciles PersistPauseStore onto a real
//     SQLite-backed PauseStore against this same table"). This file closes
//     it: sqlitestore.go (this same role's exclusive path) gains
//     GetProgress/SaveProgress methods, backed by pause_records' own
//     state_checkpoint_id/repository_checkpoint_id columns (already
//     present, migration 0050) plus metadata_json (already used for
//     TriggerReason) for the two boolean markers and the WakeJobID scalar
//     — no new migration needed, no schema change, just reading/writing
//     columns that already exist.
//
// # Mapping each frozen method onto existing pieces
//
// See each method's own doc comment below for the full rationale; in
// summary:
//
//	Observe        -> runway.Scorer.Score (produces the forecast the
//	                   frozen signature returns) composed with per-session/
//	                   per-limit burn-rate history this Service tracks
//	                   internally, then fed through Observer.Observe for
//	                   its side-effecting debounce/hysteresis bookkeeping.
//	RequestPause   -> pause.RequestPause, via SessionContextResolver.
//	ReachSafePoint -> pause.PersistThenInterrupt's ordering guarantee,
//	                   with pause.Persist (persistphase.go) itself as the
//	                   CheckpointPersister, and InterruptAndSleep's own
//	                   Interrupter/TurnInterrupterAdapter as the Interrupter.
//	EnterSleep     -> the wake job pause.Persist's own phase 5 already
//	                   scheduled (looked up via scheduler.Store.
//	                   GetByPauseKind, the same idempotent-recovery lookup
//	                   persistphase.go already uses) -- ReachSafePoint has
//	                   already driven the record to Sleeping by the time
//	                   EnterSleep is called, per the frozen state path.
//	Resume         -> pause.ValidateResume, mapped via
//	                   ResumeValidationResult.Verdict() onto pause.Resume.
//	Cancel         -> pause.Cancel.

// own phase 5 already scheduled the wake job) and Interrupting into
// Sleeping (InterruptAndSleep) -- so EnterSleep's OWN job is narrower than
// its name might suggest: report the WakeJob Persist already scheduled,
// not perform a fresh transition. This mirrors the frozen state path's own
// framing exactly (agents/runtime.md: "...persisting -> interrupting ->
// sleeping -> wake_due..." -- Sleeping is reached BEFORE wake_due, i.e.
// before this method is meaningfully callable at all for a pause that
// hasn't already gone through ReachSafePoint). Looked up via
// scheduler.Store.GetByPauseKind -- the same idempotent-recovery read
// persistphase.go's own scheduleWakeJobIdempotent already established, not
// a new lookup mechanism.
//
// If the record is not yet Sleeping (a caller invoking EnterSleep out of
// sequence, e.g. before ReachSafePoint ever ran), this method fails closed
// with a TransitionError rather than silently scheduling a second,
// out-of-band wake job -- consistent with InterruptAndSleep's own

// ("Resume here therefore implements only the STATE MACHINE half of a
