// reconcile.go: startup reconciliation for Service.Create's own crash
// windows (agents/checkpoint.md Part A deliverable #6, checkpoint-a06;
// ADD §18.9 "On startup/resume"). This is deliberately narrower than, and
// separate from, internal/progress.Reconciler (checkpoint-a04's own
// startup reconciliation for CompleteNode's staged-artifact-vs-DB crash
// window) — that reconciler targets a DIFFERENT crash window entirely
// (FileStager's evidence directory vs. the artifacts table, scoped to
// node completion). This file's Reconciler targets Create's own, narrower
// sequence: read tree state -> build/seal manifest -> insert row.
//
// # What crash windows actually exist in Create
//
// Tracing Create's three phases (Phase/HaltAfter in service.go) against
// what is actually durable at each point:
//
//   - PhaseReadTree (after ListNodes/ListArtifacts): nothing written yet.
//     A crash here is a pure no-op from this package's perspective — the
//     next Create call (or the caller's own retry) starts fresh. Nothing
//     to reconcile.
//   - PhaseSeal (after Build/Seal/Marshal produce a fully self-checksummed
//     manifest in memory): still nothing written. Same as above.
//   - PhaseInsert (after Store.Insert's single INSERT statement commits):
//     this is the ONE phase where durable state exists. Store.Insert is a
//     single SQL statement, which SQLite commits atomically — there is no
//     reachable "half-inserted row" state for this package to crash into
//     (unlike internal/repocheckpoint's multi-file artifact writes, which
//     is exactly why that package needs a temp-dir-then-atomic-rename
//     protocol and this one does not). So the real question a startup
//     reconciler must answer is not "is this row half-written" (it
//     cannot be) but "is this row - now that it durably exists -
//     everything CompleteNode's Constitution §6.2/§6.5 requires backing
//     evidence to be": a well-formed schema version, a manifest whose
//     digest still matches what is stored (bit rot / an interrupted
//     future rewrite this package does not currently perform, but
//     "trust nothing, recompute" is this whole role's governing
//     discipline per internal/repocheckpoint/verify.go's identical
//     stance), and a manifest whose own task_id/checkpoint_id agree with
//     the row's queryable columns (a crash during some future migration
//     or manual DB surgery diverging the two, caught the same way
//     internal/repocheckpoint.Verify cross-checks manifest.CheckpointID
//     against row.ID).
//
// Reconcile therefore proves the negative case exhaustively (crash at any
// phase never leaves a row that looks complete but isn't backed by
// verified evidence, Constitution §6.5) rather than "fixing" anything —
// there is nothing for it to repair, by construction, since the only
// durable-state phase is a single atomic statement. Every check below is a
// read-only integrity scan; Reconcile never deletes, rewrites, or
// re-inserts a row itself (mirrors internal/repocheckpoint.Verify and
// internal/progress.Reconciler both being read-only diagnostic passes,
// never self-healing writers).
