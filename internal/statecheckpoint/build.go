// build.go: assembles a Manifest from the Progress Tree state a caller
// already has in hand (BuildInput), independent of how that state was
// gathered. internal/progress's CompleteNode protocol (checkpoint-a04) is
// this function's primary caller — it reads node/edge/artifact rows
// inside its own transaction and hands the resulting snapshot here rather
// than this package reaching into internal/progress's stores directly,
// keeping the Part A internal boundary (stores vs. checkpoint manifest)
// as real as the Part A/Part B boundary agents/checkpoint.md documents.
