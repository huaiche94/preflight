// restoredryrun.go: checkpoint-b08's "Restore dry-run" deliverable
// (agents/checkpoint.md Part B deliverable #9; Preflight_ADD.md §19.6
// "Restore"). Actual restore-that-mutates-the-working-tree remains
// explicitly out of vertical-slice scope (this node's own DAG risk note: "actual
// restore is stretch/deferred") — app.RepositoryCheckpointService.Restore
// (the frozen port method) NEVER writes to the working tree, index, or any
// ref; it only reports, in full ADD §19.6 detail, what a real restore
// WOULD do if one existed.
//
// ADD §19.6 lists restore's required checks almost verbatim as this file's
// own steps: "verify checksum; verify repo identity; reject path
// traversal; reject dirty target unless safety checkpoint/force; git apply
// --check; staged/unstaged separately; never delete extra files unless
// --exact; produce report." Every one of those is implemented below EXCEPT
// the two that only apply to a MUTATING restore ("never delete extra files
// unless --exact" has nothing to check without a real apply step) — dry-run
// mutates nothing, so there is nothing to constrain there yet; that
// constraint's real enforcement point is whatever future node builds actual
// restore.
