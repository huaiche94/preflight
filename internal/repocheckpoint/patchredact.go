// patchredact.go: corrective fix for the gap qa-05's leakage scanner
// (internal/integrationtest/leakage_scanner_test.go,
// TestLeakageScanner_KnownGap_SecretInTrackedFileDiffIsNotFiltered) and this
// package's own checkpoint-b06-era untracked_test.go
// (TestCapture_Untracked_SecretScan_NeverAppliesToTrackedDiffContent)
// independently documented: internal/redact's secret scan was wired only
// into the untracked-file archive path (archive.go's buildUntrackedArchive)
// and never applied to the staged/unstaged patch content Capture generates
// via gitx.Client.DiffPatch. A secret-shaped string staged into a TRACKED
// file (e.g. an API key typo'd into a config file before a commit) was
// captured verbatim, unredacted, into staged.patch.gz/unstaged.patch.gz.
//
// # Design choice: redact-in-place, not skip-with-manifest-annotation
//
// ADD §19.3's Capture sequence lists "secret/size/symlink filters" as step
// 8, positioned generally between diff generation (steps 5-6) and archival
// (step 9) — it is not scoped narrowly to untracked files the way §19.5's
// own "Untracked policy" section states its "secret scan" bullet. That
// general placement is this package's basis for extending the filter to the
// patch content too, rather than treating the boundary as accepted.
//
// Two ways to close the gap were considered:
//
//  1. Redact detected secret spans within the patch content itself before
//     archiving (this file's approach).
//  2. Refuse to include a patch that contains a detected secret and record
//     a SkipReason/annotation in the manifest, mirroring the untracked-
//     archive skip-ledger pattern.
//
// Redact-in-place was chosen because:
//
//   - §19.6 Restore (dry-run and any future real restore) requires
//     `git apply --check` against the staged/unstaged patches. Option 2
//     would mean a checkpoint containing so much as one secret-shaped
//     staged line has NO patch to restore-check against at all — the
//     entire staged or unstaged changeset's evidence is lost, not just the
//     one sensitive line. Redaction preserves the patch's file headers and
//     hunk structure so restore dry-run (checkpoint-b08) remains
//     meaningful for the rest of the changeset.
//   - A staged/unstaged diff is one unified patch blob per side (unlike
//     untracked files, which are individually excludable candidates in a
//     zip archive). Skipping the whole patch on one detected secret line
//     would discard every unrelated legitimate change in that patch too —
//     a much larger loss of evidence than the untracked-archive path's
//     per-file skip.
//   - Redaction can be applied conservatively (see below) without
//     invalidating the patch's applicability, which the untracked-archive
//     skip-ledger approach cannot offer any equivalent of (there is no
//     partial-file capture there either).
//
// # Redaction scope: added/removed lines only, never context lines
//
// A unified diff's context lines (leading space) must match the target
// file's actual content exactly for `git apply` to locate the hunk;
// rewriting a context line's content would silently corrupt the patch's
// own applicability. Only "+" (added) and "-" (removed) line bodies are
// scanned and, if they match internal/redact's detectors, replaced
// wholesale with a fixed placeholder — this changes what the hunk records
// as added/removed content (the point: the secret must not survive into
// the archive) while leaving line count, hunk headers (@@ ... @@), file
// headers (diff --git/index/---/+++), and every context line byte-for-byte
// intact, so the patch remains structurally valid and still applies
// (checkpoint-b08's dry-run `git apply --check` continues to succeed
// against the redacted patch, since redaction never touches context lines
// or hunk arithmetic).
//
// Binary patches (`GIT binary patch` directives) are left untouched:
// internal/redact's detectors are plaintext pattern matches and binary
// literal-diff content already contains no such shapes worth scanning
// (mirrors internal/redact's own IsLikelyBinary skip for the untracked
// path); a binary blob also cannot be partially redacted without producing
// an undecodable patch.
